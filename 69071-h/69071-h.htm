<p>Could one lift the impenetrable veil of mystery that
hides the future from our curious eyes, what secrets would
often be revealed, what shadows would fall upon hearts
now light and thoughtless—shadows of grief, of horror,
and despair!</p>

<p>“It is better not to know,” agree both the poets and
sages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[6]</span></p>

<p>Beautiful Cinthia Dawn did not think of that as she
drummed upon the window-pane that rainy autumn day,
exclaiming rebelliously:</p>

<p>“I wish something would happen to break up the
dreadful monotony of my life.”</p>

<p>Widow Flint, who was her aunt and guardian, and as
crabbed and crusty as her name, looked at her with
dismay, and retorted:</p>

<p>“Some people don’t know when they’re well off. You
have enough to eat, to drink, and to wear, and a good
home. What more do you want?”</p>

<p>The girl looked at the dingy sitting-room, her own
shabby gray gown, then out at the dismal landscape,
blurred by the rain and low-hanging clouds, with something
like frank contempt, and answered, recklessly:</p>

<p>“I want pretty clothes and jewels, beautiful surroundings,
gay times, and lovers, such as other girls have instead
of this humdrum, poky existence—so there!”</p>

<p>“Humph!”</p>

<p>It was all Mrs. Flint said aloud, but to herself she
added:</p>

<p>“Good land! I do wish my brother would come home
from his eternal wanderings and take charge of his rattled-brained
daughter. She’s too pretty and restless, and
I don’t see how I’m going to hold her down much
longer.”</p>

<p>Cinthia Dawn was seventeen now, and ever since she
had been given into her aunt’s sole keeping at five years<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
old, the strait-laced soul, who was as prim and particular
as an old maid, had been engaged in the difficult task of
“holding down” her spirited young niece. She had even
erred on the side of prudence, so great was her anxiety to
bring her up in the way she should go.</p>

<p>When the lovely child first came her aunt said frankly
to all:</p>

<p>“I don’t want anybody ever to tell Cinthy that she is
pretty.”</p>

<p>“She can find it out for herself by just looking in the
glass,” objected one of her cronies.</p>

<p>“I’ll tend to that,” said Mrs. Flint, crustily, and she
furnished her rooms with cracked and distorted mirrors,
whose blurred surfaces gave back indeed no fair reflection
of the child’s beauty.</p>

<p>She carried out her programme further by dressing the
child in the plainest, commonest clothing, and plaiting all
her wealth of golden curls in a single tail down her back,
though she could not prevent it even then from breaking
out on her brow and neck in enchanting little ringlets that
a ballroom belle might have envied.</p>

<p>To her dearest crony Mrs. Flint excused her course
by saying, confidentially:</p>

<p>“Cinthy’s mother, who is dead now, was the vainest
and prettiest creature on earth, and she did wicked work
with her beauty. I don’t want to say aught against her
now that she is dead; but Cinthy must have a different
raising, that’s all. My brother said so when he put her<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
in my charge. ‘Bring her up good and simple in your
old-fashion way, Rebecca,’ was what he said.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. ‘Favor is deceitful and beauty is vain,
but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.’
That’s Cinthy’s Bible verse, and I hope she’ll live up to
it,” returned the good crony, Deacon Rood’s wife.</p>

<p>So Cinthia Dawn was reared simply and plainly almost
to severity. She received her education at the public
school, and at home helped her aunt with the house-work.
Surreptitiously she read poetry and novels.</p>

<p>Such a simple, quiet life—just like thousands and thousands
of others—but Cinthia was outgrowing it now.
She was seventeen—the most romantic age in the world—and
she chafed at the dreariness of her life.</p>

<p>School-days were ended now, and her merry mates
had their new gowns, their dances, and their lovers. There
were none of these for Cinthia Dawn.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flint said her niece was nothing but a child yet,
so she was not permitted to attend parties, and she vowed
she had no money to spend on finery. As for lovers, if
she had any, the bravest would not have dared present
himself at Mrs. Flint’s door. She would have said to him
as to the veriest tramp:</p>

<p>“Be off!”</p>

<p>It was just the life to drive a pretty, spirited girl frantic
with impatience of the present, and longings for something
better than she had known—the longing that found
impatient expression that afternoon when she watched the<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
dead leaves flying in sodden drifts beneath the chill November
rain.</p>

<p>After Mrs. Flint’s curt rejoinder to her complaints she
remained silent several minutes drumming impatiently on
the pane, then burst out:</p>

<p>“Oh, Aunt Beck, don’t you want me to run down to
the post-office for your <cite>Christian Advocate</cite>?”</p>

<p>“In all this storm?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I won’t mind it a bit! I’m in a mood for fighting
the elements!”</p>

<p>“Then take your umbrella and overshoes, and hurry
back.”</p>

<p>“Yes, aunt.”</p>

<p>Glad to escape from the monotony of the little brown
house, she hurried out into the teeth of the storm, and
made her way through the village streets to the little post-office.
The rain blew in her face, and the wind crimsoned
her cheeks and made her dark eyes flash like stars. Cinthia
did not care. In her splendor of youth and health she
found it exhilarating.</p>

<p>But going back, the storm, that had been gathering its
forces for a fiercer onslaught, increased in angry violence.</p>

<p>She had left the paved main street, too, now, and was
emerging into the thinly populated suburbs where her home
was situated.</p>

<p>A great gust of wind met her at the corner of a street,
taking her breath with its fierce onslaught, wrapping her
damp skirts about her ankles, and whisking her umbrella<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
from her grasp. She chased it wildly almost a block, only
to see it whirled into the middle of the street and crushed
under the wheels of a heavily loaded farm wagon lumbering
into the little town. Meanwhile, the vagrant wind
pelted her with drifts of dead leaves, and the flood-gates
of heaven opened and poured down torrents of water.</p>

<p>“Take my umbrella, Miss Dawn!” cried the gay musical
voice of a young man who had been chasing her as
fast as she flew after the umbrella.</p>

<p>Turning with a quick start, she looked into the face of
Arthur Varian, a new comer in the town, with whom she
had recently formed an acquaintance. His laughing blue
eyes were irresistible, and she cried merrily as she took
shelter under the umbrella:</p>

<p>“Didn’t I look comical chasing the parachute? I was
hoping no one saw me. Thank you, but I can not deprive
you of it.”</p>

<p>“Then you will let me hold it over you? It is large
enough for both,” stepping along by her side, and giving
her the best half of it as they struggled along against the
high wind. “I saw you coming out of the post-office and
have been trying to overtake you ever since. I thought
perhaps you would allow me the pleasure of walking home
with you,” continued Arthur Varian, bending his admiring
blue eyes on the beautiful face by his side—the bright,
arch face with its large, soft dark eyes set off by that
aureole of curly golden hair, now blown into the most
enchanting spiral rings by the wind and rain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[11]</span></p>

<p>He had met her several times before, and he knew
enough of her lonely life to make him sympathize with her
forlornness, even if her beauty had not already charmed
him with its girlish perfection.</p>

<p>Cinthia met that glance and looked down with a kindling
blush and a wildly beating heart, for—it was of him
she had been thinking when she uttered her complaints
to Mrs. Flint, longing for the privileges of other young
girls of her class that she might have opportunities of
meeting him and winning his heart.</p>

<p>Who could blame her? for Arthur Varian was very
winning and handsome—tall, with wavy brown hair, regular
features, a slight brown mustache, a beautiful
mouth—“just made for kissing,” vowed all the girls—well
dressed, and having that indefinable air of ease and
elegance that betokens good breeding joined to prosperity.</p>

<p>Perhaps the fates had heard Cinthia’s longing for something
to happen, for the storm now gathered fresh force,
and the darkening earth was irradiated by a vivid and
brilliant flash of lightning, followed by a terrific thunder
peal.</p>

<p>The rain poured out of heaven like a waterfall, and
the fierce driving gale caught the frightened girl up like
a feather and tossed her against the young man’s breast
and into his arms, that clasped and held her protectingly,
while all about them the air was darkened with flying
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i> and broken branches of trees that swayed, and<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
creaked, and bent, and crashed in agony beneath the
cyclonic force of the elements.</p>

<p>Cinthia was not a coward, but the situation was enough
to strike terror to the bravest heart. The edge of a
cyclone had indeed struck the village, and in almost an instant
of time dozens of trees had been uprooted, several
houses unroofed, and the air filled with flying projectiles,
one of which suddenly struck Arthur Varian with such
force that both he and his companion were hurled to the
ground. It was a portion of a tin roof, and cut a gash
on the young man’s hand from which the blood began
to stream in a ruddy tide.</p>

<p>In another minute the wind began to abate, and they
struggled up to their feet.</p>

<p>“Oh, you are cut, you are bleeding! and you did it to
save me! I saw you ward off that horrible missile from
me with your hand. It must have killed me had I received
the blow, for, as it was, it grazed my head. Oh,
what can I do? Let me bind your hand to stop the
blood,” sobbed Cinthia, unwinding the silk scarf from her
neck and wrapping it tightly, with untaught skill, about
his wrist above the wound to stop the spurting blood.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">ONE GOLDEN HOUR.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>She trembled and paled as the warm blood spurted over
her own white and dainty hands as she essayed the task,
and her heart throbbed wildly with new and sweet emotion.
She could have clasped her arms about his neck
and wept over the cruel wound he had received in her defense
and for her sake.</p>

<p>“Thank you. That will do very well,” Arthur Varian
cried, gratefully; and taking her hand gently, he added:
“I see we are almost at the gates of my home. You must
come in with me till the storm is over, then I will take
you home in the carriage.”</p>

<p>Thoroughly frightened, and glad of a shelter from the
still angry elements, Cinthia accompanied him inside the
gates of the finest residence in the county—Idlewild, as
it was called—being a large rambling old stone mansion,
exceedingly picturesque in style, and surrounded by a
fine estate in lawns, gardens, and virgin woodlands. For
many years the place had been tenantless, save for the old
housekeeper in charge, but last summer it had been carefully
renovated, and Arthur Varian and his widowed
mother, who owned the place, had come there to live.</p>

<p>As the young man led Cinthia in, he added, thoughtfully:</p>

<p>“You are quite drenched, but my mother will give<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
you some hot tea and dry clothing, and perhaps that will
prevent your getting sick.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t think the wetting will hurt me. I’m very
strong,” Cinthia answered; adding, bashfully: “I
shouldn’t like your mother to see me looking like I had
been fished out of the river. You had better take me to
the housekeeper. I know her well. She has been lending
me novels and poetry from your library ever since I was
a little girl.”</p>

<p>And, in fact, before they rang the bell the front door
flew open, and the old woman appeared, pouncing upon
Cinthia, and exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Come right in out of the wet, you poor, dear child!
I saw it all from the window, and I thought you both
were killed when the piece of tin knocked you both down.
I believe it is a piece off of our own roof. My heart
jumped in my mouth, and I was about to faint when I
saw you both rising to your feet, and I got better at
once. But, law sakes! wasn’t it terrible? Your hand’s
cut, too, ain’t it, Mr. Varian? Well, I’ll see to’t in a
minute, as soon as I take Cinthy to my room.”</p>

<p>Leading the dripping girl along the corridors to a plain,
neat bedroom, she produced a dainty white night-gown,
saying:</p>

<p>“There, honey; jest strip off your wet clothes and
put on that, and jump into my bed and kiver up warm,
whiles I go and sew up that cut on Mr. Arthur’s hand,
for I can do it jest as neat as any doctor. Then I’ll dry<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
your clothes and brew you both some bone-set tea to keep
you from ketching cold.”</p>

<p>She bustled away, and Cinthia gladly did as she was
bid, looking ruefully at the puddles of water that streamed
from her clothing on to the neat Brussels carpet.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Bowles returned she was indeed covered
up in the warm bed, with only her bright eyes and the
top of her golden head visible.</p>

<p>“Do you feel chilly, dearie? Drink this, to warm your
blood,” she said, forcing a bitter concoction of bone-set
tea on the protesting girl; adding: “Law, now, ’tisn’t so
bad, after all, is it? Why, Mr. Varian drank <em>his</em> dose
without so much as a wry face. Law, honey, but that
was a deep cut! It almost severed an artery. It took
all my nerve to sew it up, I tell you, and he’ll have to
carry his hand in a sling some time, sure.”</p>

<p>“He saved my life!” cried Cinthia, eagerly. “I would
have received that blow on my head but that he so quickly
warded it off with his hand. See, it just grazed my
temple,” showing a little bleeding scratch under her ringlets.</p>

<p>“Dearie me, let me put a strip of court-plaster on it!
There, it’ll be well in a day or two. Now, Cinthia, you
take a little nap whiles I hang your clothes to dry in the
laundry,” gathering them up into a bucket.</p>

<p>“I’ve ruined your carpet,” sighed the girl.</p>

<p>“Oh, no; it’ll be all right when it’s dry. Them colors<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
won’t run. Don’t worrit over that, but shet your eyes and
go to sleep,” bustling out again.</p>

<p>“Dear old soul!” sighed Cinthia, grateful for the kiss
pressed on top of her curly head. She shut her eyes, but
she was too nervous to sleep.</p>

<p>She lay listening to the storm that still raged outside,
and wondering what her aunt would think of her protracted
stay, if she would be angry, or just frightened.
Then her thoughts flew to Arthur Varian, his tender
smiles, his bonny blue eyes.</p>

<p>“I will never marry any man but a blue-eyed one,”
she thought, thrillingly, and at last fell into a gentle doze
induced by weariness, the warmth of the bed, and the
dose she had swallowed.</p>

<p>The nap lasted an hour, and when she opened her
eyes Mrs. Bowles was rocking placidly by the cozy fire
in the twilight.</p>

<p>“Oh, I have been asleep! How long?” she cried, uneasily.</p>

<p>“Most an hour. Do you feel rested?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, indeed, and I’d like to get up and go home.
Are my clothes dry?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no—not yet; and as for that gray woolen frock
of yours, it has shrunk that much you can never hook it
up again, I can tell you that! But no matter. You’ve
had it two years a’ready. I know, and it was too skimp
for a growing girl, anyway. But Mrs. Varian has sent<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
you in a suit of her clothes to put on, and when you’re
dressed you are to take tea with her and her son.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but, Mrs. Bowles, I ought to go home at once.
Aunt Beck will be so uneasy over me.”</p>

<p>“Listen to the wind and the rain, child. The storm
is still raging, and the horses can’t be taken out till the
weather clears up. So make your mind easy, and get
up and dress, for Mrs. Varian will be in to see you
presently.”</p>

<p>Cinthia got up rather nervously, with a little dread of
Mrs. Varian, whom she had seen at church and out riding—a
beautiful, haughty-looking woman, with olive skin
and flashing dark eyes, very young looking to have a
grown son of twenty-three or four.</p>

<p>“I would rather have my own clothes,” she said pleadingly.</p>

<p>“They are all over mud and water, child, and I don’t
think the maid can have them fit for you till to-morrow.
Mrs. Varian very kindly offered the loan of hers, and
unless you wear them, you’ll have to go to bed again,
that’s all. Here, let me help you,” said Mrs. Bowles, beginning
to slip the garments over Cinthia’s shining head.</p>

<p>“But this crimson silk with white lace trimmings—it is
too fine for me, dear Mrs. Bowles.”</p>

<p>“It can’t be helped, for this is more likely to fit—too
tight in the waist for her, she said, and she never wore it
but twice; and see, it laps over two inches on you. But I
can hide that with the lace at the neck and the bow at<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
the waist. Now let me comb your hair loose over your
shoulders, it’s so damp yet. My! how it crimples up and
curls, and shines in the light! You look well, Cinthy
Dawn!” She would have said <em>beautiful</em>, but she was
mindful of Mrs. Flint’s objection, though she said to
herself:</p>

<p>“She can’t keep Mr. Arthur from finding it out, that’s
sure. He knows it a’ready, by the look in his eyes when
he brought her in. And it’s hot, impulsive blood that
flows in the Varians’ veins. What is going to come of this
accident, I wonder? for I saw love in her eyes when she
told me how he saved her life. I hope he didn’t save it
just to blight it.”</p>

<p>Cinthia went to the old woman’s mirror and looked at
herself in the unaccustomed gown.</p>

<p>The glass was not blurred and cracked like those at
home, and it gave back her charming reflection truthfully.</p>

<p>“Why, how pretty I look!” she cried, gazing in frank
delight at the beautiful vision, the lissom form, just above
medium height, the regular features, the fair arch face,
the starry dark eyes, the rose-red mouth, the enchanting
dimples, and the aureole of golden hair that set it off
like a halo of light. “Why, Mrs. Bowles, I did not
know I was so pretty! But perhaps it’s only the dress.”</p>

<p>“Fine feathers make fine birds,” returned the housekeeper,
discreetly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” sighed Cinthia; but she continued to gaze at<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
herself in delight, wondering, shyly, what Arthur Varian
would think of her in his mother’s fine gown.</p>

<p>Then she turned with a start, for a light tap at the
door announced the entrance of Mrs. Varian, and the
housekeeper hastened to present the young girl to her mistress.</p>

<p>Both thrilled with admiration, for both were rarely
beautiful in their opposite types, the elder a brunette of
the finest style, the younger a dark-eyed blonde, so rarely
seen, so much admired.</p>

<p>“I hope you have quite recovered from your fright,
Miss Dawn,” her hostess said, in a voice so exquisitely
modulated that it was as pleasant as music.</p>

<p>Cinthia murmured in reply that she had enjoyed a delicious
rest, and was so grateful for the loan of the
clothes that made it possible for her to escape from bed.</p>

<p>“I dare say our good Mrs. Bowles would have liked
to keep you there all night. She suggested that plan to
Arthur after dosing him with bitter herb tea; but he disregarded
her advice, and is now waiting impatiently for
you,” rejoined the lady, casting an arch glance at the old
woman while she took Cinthia’s hand and drew her toward
the door.</p>

<p>When the door closed on them the old housekeeper
wagged her head doubtfully.</p>

<p>“How sweet my mistress can be when she pleases; but
I wonder if she would be as kind if she guessed what I
have read in those young peoples’ eyes—that story of<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
love—love between a rich young man and a poor young
girl, that folks like Mrs. Varian call misalliances?” she
muttered, uneasily.</p>

<p>No matter what the outcome was to be, Cinthia Dawn
had come to the happiest night of her life.</p>

<p>Though outside the windows the wild wind and rain
swirled and beat with ghostly fingers, inside Mrs. Varian’s
luxurious drawing-room all was warmth and light and
pleasure.</p>

<p>The lady and her son exerted themselves to make their
young guest happy, and she was so glad and grateful in
her pleasant surroundings that all were mutually sorry
when toward ten o’clock the storm abated, and the moon
struggled fitfully through the lowering clouds.</p>

<p>“I must go home!” cried Cinthia, with wholesome
dread of Mrs. Flint’s wrath; and their warmest urgings
could not prevail on her to stay—though in her secret
heart she longed to do so forever. “I shall bring back
your clothes to-morrow,” she laughed, as Mrs. Varian
bid her a cordial good-night.</p>

<p>Then Arthur handed her into the waiting carriage,
stepped in by her side, and the driver closed the door; and
of that ride home we shall hear more in our next chapter.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE SWEET OLD STORY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Mrs. Flint grew very uneasy over her absent niece as
the short afternoon waned and the fury of the storm
increased to positive danger for any luckless pedestrian.
After fidgeting and worrying until the early twilight fell,
she began to say to herself that Cinthia was probably
all right, anyway. She had doubtless gone into some
friend’s for shelter, and would not likely return until
morning.</p>

<p>She took her frugal tea alone and in something like
sadness, for Cinthia had seldom been absent from a meal
before, and she began to feel what a loss it was to miss
the fair young face about the house. She suddenly realized
the tenderness lying dormant in her heart for the
wilful girl.</p>

<p>She sat down by the cozy fire with her knitting, and
listened to the tempest of wind and rain soughing in the
trees outside, and Cinthia’s rebellion that afternoon kept
repeating itself over and over in her brain until she muttered
aloud:</p>

<p>“She wants fine things and parties and lovers, does
she? Well, well, I s’pose it’s natural enough for her
mother’s child, and for any young girl for that matter, but
where’s she going to get them? The lovers would be
easy enough—she’s as pretty as a pink—but I don’t want<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
to encourage her vanity, and it’s better to save the money
her father sends till she needs it worse. What if he
should die way off yonder somewhere, and maybe not
leave her a penny? I wish he’d come home, I do, or I
wish she was homely as sin, with red hair and freckles,
and a snub nose like Jane Ann Johnson!”</p>

<p>So she fretted and fumed until past ten o’clock, and
that was an hour beyond her usual bed-time; but somehow
she could not get Cinthia out of her mind, could not
bear to retire while she was away, so she kept glancing at
the window, though scarcely expecting her to arrive before
morning. How could she, in such a storm, though
the wind had lulled somewhat, and the patter of the rain
was dulled on the drifts of dead leaves that muffled the
sound of carriage-wheels, pausing too, so that Mrs. Flint
almost jumped out of her skin when there suddenly came
a loud rat-a-tat, rat-a-tat, upon the front door.</p>

<p>But she was not naturally nervous, so after a moment’s
startled indecision, she flew to the door and demanded,
through the key-hole, to know who was there.</p>

<p>“It is Cinthia, aunt,” returned a sweet, mirthful voice.</p>

<p>With a sigh of relief the old lady unlocked the door,
and there stepped into the narrow hall a vision that took
her breath away.</p>

<p>Was it Cinthia Dawn or a fairy princess, this beautiful
creature in the crimson silk and misty lace, the furred
white opera-cloak falling from her shoulders, the rippling
lengths of sunny hair enveloping her like a halo, the dark<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
eyes beaming with “that light that never was on sea or
land,” but only in the glance of the happy and the loving?</p>

<p>“Cinthia Dawn!” she began, in a dazed voice; but
just then she became aware that a tall and handsome
young man, hat in hand, was standing on the threshold.
She knew who he was. Her pastor had introduced her
last Sunday, at church, to the master of Idlewild.</p>

<p>“Good-evening, Mrs. Flint,” he began, beamingly. “I
have brought Cinthia home safe to you. My mother took
care of her during the storm.” He paused, faintly hoping
that she would ask him to enter, it was so early yet.</p>

<p>But he did not yet know Mrs. Flint, much as he had
heard of her eccentricities. She simply bridled, and returned,
in her stiffest manner:</p>

<p>“I’m sure we are <em>very</em> much obliged to your mother,
and you, too. Good-evening.”</p>

<p>Thus curtly dismissed, the young man shot a tender
glance at his sweetheart, and bowed himself out into the
night again, the lady slamming the door behind him before
he was fairly down the steps.</p>

<p>“Oh, Aunt Beck! how could you be so rude after all
their kindness to me? And he saved my life, too. Didn’t
you see his arm in a sling?” indignantly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know as I noticed it. I was so flustrated seeing
you bringing a beau home, and you nothing but a child
yet!” snapped the old lady.</p>

<p>“<em>Child!</em>” echoed Cinthia, scornfully, as she held her<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
chilly fingers to the blaze and the ruddy light played over
her beautiful garments.</p>

<p>“But what are you doing with the silk gown, and that
grand white cloak, all brocade and ermine? I don’t
understand!” cried the old lady, suspiciously.</p>

<p>Cinthia laughed out gayly, happily, her eyes shining,
her voice as sweet as silver bells.</p>

<p>“Why, I was caught in the rain and almost drowned,
Aunt Beck, and my wretched old duds were nothing but
mud and water, so Mrs. Varian lent me these things to
come home in. Aren’t they becoming? Don’t I look
pretty?” setting her graceful head one side, like a bird.</p>

<p>“Humph! ‘Pretty is as pretty does,’” grunted her
aunt, though she could not keep her eyes off the charming
creature as she flung herself back in an easy-chair and
continued, gayly:</p>

<p>“If you are not sleepy, Aunt Beck, I’ll tell you all
about it.”</p>

<p>“I guess I can keep my eyes open!” ungraciously,
though she was dying of curiosity.</p>

<p>Thereupon Cinthia related all the events of the evening,
from the time she had left home until she bid Mrs.
Varian good-night to return in the grand carriage with
the handsome master of Idlewild. Clasping her tiny
hands, she cried, in an ecstacy:</p>

<p>“Oh, aunt, I can’t tell you how I enjoyed it all! Mrs.
Varian is as proud and beautiful as a queen; but she was
so kind and sweet to me that I felt quite at home in<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
her grand house. As for her son—oh!” and Cinthia
paused and blushed divinely.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flint snapped, irately:</p>

<p>“Now, Cinthia Dawn, don’t you go getting your head
turned by idle flatteries from rich young men. Anybody
but a silly child would know they don’t mean anything.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Aunt Beck, please don’t call me a <em>child</em> any more.
I am as grown up as anybody, and you know it—seventeen
last April. And—and”—wistfully and defiantly all
at once—“he <em>does</em> mean it. He loves me dearly—and—we—are—engaged!”</p>

<p>Aunt Beck gave a jump of uncontrollable surprise.</p>

<p>“Cinthy Dawn, you don’t mean it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do, Aunt Beck. I have promised to marry
Arthur Varian.”</p>

<p>“But, land sakes, <em>child</em>—oh, I forgot; well girl, then—you
don’t hardly know each other!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we do. We have been acquainted some time.
We fell in love weeks ago, and—and—he told me in the
carriage he loved me and wanted to marry me.”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">BREAKERS AHEAD.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Mrs. Flint was so surprised she could not speak; she
could only stare in wonder at the beautiful, excited
creature with her happy face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[26]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, aunt, you are not angry, are you? He’s very,
very nice, I’m sure—and rich, too! He said my every
fancy should be gratified—that he would worship me.
You will give your consent, won’t you, because he’s coming
here to-morrow morning to ask you.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Flint found her voice, and muttered, sarcastically:</p>

<p>“A wonder he didn’t ask me to-night! Why didn’t
you tell him you would have to get your father’s consent?”</p>

<p>“Because papa has deserted me ever since I was small,
and cares nothing for me. It is you I’ve had to look for
the care of father and mother both. Why, look you, papa
has never written me a line all these years! He does not
care what becomes of me. And we shall not ask him
anything. You are my guardian, and will give us leave
to marry, won’t you, dear?”</p>

<p>“When, Cinthy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, very soon, he said—not later than Christmas,
anyway. We don’t want to wait long. You’ll be willing,
won’t you?” impetuously.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, dear. I’ll have to sleep on it before
I make up my mind; you’ve given me such a surprise.
Though I don’t say but that it’s a grand match for a girl
like you, Cinthy.”</p>

<p>“He said I was made for a prince.”</p>

<p>“Of course. People in love are silly enough to say
anything. But take your candle and go to bed now,
Cinthy, and we will talk about this again to-morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[27]</span></p>

<p>“Good-night, aunt,” and she lingered, perhaps hoping
for a kindlier word.</p>

<p>The old lady, moved in spite of herself, and secretly
proud of Cinthia’s conquest, actually kissed the rosy
cheek, saying, merrily:</p>

<p>“Good-night—Mrs. Varian that is to be.”</p>

<p>Cinthia’s heart leaped with joy and pride, for she took
this concession to mean approbation of her choice.</p>

<p>With the chorus of a love song Arthur had sung that
evening on her happy lips, she went upstairs to her pretty
bed-room, and was soon fast asleep and dreaming sweetly
of her splendid lover.</p>

<p>But as for Mrs. Flint, she sat down again by the fire,
in a sort of dazed condition, to think it all over.</p>

<p>Little Cinthia engaged to be married! Why, it was
like some strange dream!</p>

<p>But the more she thought it over, the better pleased she
was, for Cinthia’s future had been a burden to her mind,
and this would be such a relief, marrying her off to such
a good catch as Arthur Varian. Why, the little girl had
done as well for herself as the most anxious father could
desire, and she decided to give her consent to the match
to-morrow without the formality of asking his advice.</p>

<p>Just as she came to this conclusion, she was startled
again by another rat-a-tat upon the door.</p>

<p>“Good gracious! Who can it be knocking there at
midnight almost? Some lunatic, surely! Or maybe Cinthia’s
beau come back to ask for her to-night, too impatient<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
to wait for morning!” she soliloquized, as she sallied
out into the hall, with the demand:</p>

<p>“Who’s there?”</p>

<p>To her utter consternation and amazement, a manly
voice replied, impatiently:</p>

<p>“Your long-lost brother, Rebecca. Open the door.
This wind is very cutting!”</p>

<p>Unlocking the door, a traveler stepped into the hall—a
tall, brown-bearded man of perhaps forty-five, blue-eyed,
and rarely handsome.</p>

<p>“Welcome, Everard!” she cried, and put her arm
around his neck and kissed him with unwonted affection.</p>

<p>He had been her baby half-brother when she was married,
the pet and pride of the family.</p>

<p>“Oh, I have such news for you! This return is very
timely!” she exclaimed, when they were seated again by
the fireside.</p>

<p>Thereupon she poured out the exciting story of his
daughter’s engagement, dilating with unusual volubility
on the eligibility of the suitor.</p>

<p>“I suppose I shall have to consent,” he said, carelessly;
then: “Oh, by the way, what is the young man’s name?”</p>

<p>“Arthur Varian.”</p>

<p>The man sprung to his feet as if she had thrust a knife
into his heart.</p>

<p>“Arthur Varian!” he repeated, trembling like a leaf
in a storm, his face growing deathly white under the
bronze of travel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[29]</span></p>

<p>“Why, Everard, what is the matter? Do you know
him? Is there anything wrong about him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, no—that is, I must see him first! Oh, Rebecca,
this is a terrible thing! How fortunate that I came in
time to nip this in the bud, for Arthur Varian can never
marry my daughter.”</p>

<p>“You will break her heart.”</p>

<p>He dropped back into his seat, groaning:</p>

<p>“I can not help it, miserable man that I am; for Cinthia
Dawn had better be dead than the bride of Arthur
Varian!”</p>

</div>

<p>Everard Dawn’s words fell on his sister’s ears with a
great shock, so deep was the anguish of his tone and the
emotion of his face, his lips trembling under the rich
brown beard, and his eyes gleaming under their heavy<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
brows like shadowed surfaces of deep blue pools, while
the pallor of his face was ghastly to behold.</p>

<p>She studied the agitated man in wonder and terror,
for he was almost like a stranger to his sister, having
never met her since he was a youth of sixteen, just entering
college.</p>

<p>Since she had married in Virginia while on a visit from
her home in the far South, her communications with her
relatives had been almost broken off; the death of her
father soon followed her marriage, and her only visit
home had been to the death-bed of her step-mother when
Everard was just entering college.</p>

<p>She was his only near relative, and she had urged the
lonely boy to visit her often, but he had never accepted
the invitation but once, having to work too hard at his
chosen profession—the law—to find time, he said.</p>

<p>Their correspondence had been infrequent, and she
knew little of him, save that he had been married twice,
and that on the death of his second wife he had brought
her his child to raise, and gone away abruptly, a broken-hearted,
lonely man.</p>

<p>Yet, as she looked at him sitting there, so handsome
still in his young, splendid prime, with threads of premature
silver creeping into the thick locks on his temples,
and remembered how heavily the shadows of grief had
stretched across his life, the woman’s heart was moved
to pity and tenderness, such as she had felt in his babyhood<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
days, when he was the pet and darling of all. Her
cold gray eyes softened with sympathy, as she cried:</p>

<p>“Surely, Everard, you have had more than your share
of sorrow in life! What new trouble is this? For, of
course, you would not oppose such a splendid match for
your daughter without grave reasons.”</p>

<p>He lifted his heavy eyes to her troubled face, and answered,
bitterly:</p>

<p>“Yes, I have reasons, grave and bitter reasons, for forbidding
this marriage, and I thank Heaven I came in
time to prevent it. But ask me nothing, Rebecca, for I
shall never willingly divulge my reasons, not even to the
man whom I must send away sorrowing to-morrow over
a broken love-dream.”</p>

<p>His voice fell to exquisite pathos, as if he almost pitied
the man he intended to wound so cruelly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flint was disappointed, crest-fallen, she had been
so elated over <a id="Ref_31" href="#BRef_31">her</a> niece’s prospects.</p>

<p>She rejoined, uneasily:</p>

<p>“I don’t know what Cinthy will say to this. Her heart
is set on Arthur Varian. He stands for everything she
longs for most, and her hatred of her life with me is
intense and rebellious. You can never reconcile her to
it again.”</p>

<p>“I must make a change in it, then, though my means
are not large,” he sighed.</p>

<p>“So much the worse, for she loves luxury and pleasure,
and her heart is almost starved for love. You know I<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
have a reserved nature, Everard, and never pet anything.
I have brought her up kindly, but rigidly, and she resents
my discipline and your neglect almost equally.”</p>

<p>“Poor girl! Perhaps she has cause. I have certainly
almost forgotten her existence in these years of exile. But
what alleviation was there to my misery except to forget?”
he cried, passionately.</p>

<p>“Poor boy!” she sighed, forgetting that he was forty-five.
She was twenty years older, and to her he appeared
young.</p>

<p>He made a movement of keen self-scorn.</p>

<p>“I don’t deserve your pity!” he cried. “I have been
a coward, shifting my burden on your shoulders, hating
to come home, weary of my life. But at last the voice
of duty clamored at my heart. I remembered you were
growing old, and that the child was almost a woman. I
came at last, but even then reluctantly. Can you ever
forgive my fault?”</p>

<p>Many times she had said to herself, in her impatience
of Cinthia’s discontent, that she could never forgive her
brother for saddling her with the care of a child in her
old age; but at the sight of him, so sad, so broken, so self-accusing,
she could not utter the words of blame that at
first had trembled on her tongue. She answered instead:</p>

<p>“What could you have done with a girl-child? And
I was the only one you could turn to in your trouble. But
I must warn you that you will not find an affectionate
daughter. You have been away so long that she scarcely<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
remembers your face, and she has chafed bitterly at
your neglect.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that is natural, and—I do not think we
shall ever be very fond of each other,” he replied, with
strange bitterness.</p>

<p>“When do you wish to see her, Everard? She is in
bed now.”</p>

<p>“Do not disturb her sweet dreams. Our interview can
easily wait till to-morrow,” he said, with strange coldness
for a man whose nearest tie was this beautiful, neglected
daughter.</p>

<p>He got up and stood with his back to the fire, his pale
troubled face in shadow.</p>

<p>“Don’t let me keep you up longer. You look pale and
tired, poor soul!” he said, kindly; adding: “Can you
give me a bed, or shall I go to the hotel?”</p>

<p>“I can give you a room,” she answered, lighting a bedroom-candle
for him and leading the way to a cozy down-stairs
chamber.</p>

<p>“Good-night. I hope you will sleep well,” she said,
leaving him to ascend to her own quarters opposite Cinthia’s
own little white-hung room that she took much pains
in beautifying after her girlish fancies.</p>

<p>She peeped in at the girl and saw that she was wrapped
in pleasant dreams, for the murmured name of Arthur
passed her lips, and she smiled in joy beneath the gazer’s
troubled eyes.</p>

<p>“Poor little girl—poor little girl!” she murmured, as<span class="pagenum">[34]</span>
she withdrew, her heart heavy with sympathy for the
sweet love-dream so soon to be blighted by the father’s
stern edict of separation.</p>

<p>“It is very, very, strange, the way Everard takes on
about it. Why, he went wild just at the very name of
Varian,” she said aloud to the large portrait of her long
dead husband, Deacon Flint, good soul, that hung over
her mantel. She had acquired a habit of talking absently
to this portrait as if it were alive.</p>

<p>She read her short chapter in the Bible, mumbled over
her prayer, and crept shivering into bed. But slumber
was far from her eyes. The events of the evening had
unstrung her nerves, and she lay awake, dreading the
dawn of the morrow that was to usher in such disappointment
and sorrow to the sleeping girl now dreaming so
happily of the lover who was never to be her husband.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">REBELLION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Cinthia would have slept later than usual that morning
but for her aunt’s hand gently shaking her as she said:</p>

<p>“Get up, Cinthy. Breakfast is almost ready. Put on
your Sunday gown, and try to look your best when you
come down-stairs.”</p>

<p>“Is—is—Arthur here—already?” cried the girl, a beautiful
flash of joy illuminating her face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[35]</span></p>

<p>“Never mind about that; only come down as soon
as you can, or the biscuit will be soggy,” returned the old
lady, hurrying out in trepidation. The sight of the beautiful,
happy face made her nervous.</p>

<p>Cinthia hurried her toilet, not taking time to plait her
hair, but letting the bright mass fall in careless waves
over the brown cloth gown—her “Sunday best.”</p>

<p>“How ugly it is!” she cried, with an envious glance at
Mrs. Varian’s finery spread over a chair; then she sped
down-stairs, wondering happily if Arthur had indeed arrived
so soon to ask her aunt’s consent.</p>

<p>But a strange man, tall, grave, brown-bearded, stood
with his back to the fire, scanning her with moody blue
eyes as she fluttered in, and Aunt Beck said in nervous
tones:</p>

<p>“Your <em>father</em>, Cinthy.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” she faltered, in more surprise than joy, and
paused, irresolute.</p>

<p>“What a pretty girl you have grown, my dear!” said
Everard Dawn, coming forward and giving her a careless
kiss. Then he took her hand and seated her at the table,
saying laughingly that her aunt had been fretting about
the biscuits.</p>

<p>No emotion had been shown on either side. The man
seemed indifferent, with an under-current of repressed
agitation; the girl was secretly wounded and indignant.
Her own father! yet he had never shown her a sign of<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>
real love. Between this pair her poor heart had been
starved for tenderness.</p>

<p>A little triumphant thought thrilled her through and
through:</p>

<p>“What do I care for his coming or going now? I shall
soon be happy with my darling!”</p>

<p>She was wondrously beautiful this morning, even in the
plain dark gown that simply served as a foil to her fairness.
Everard Dawn could not help from seeing it, and
saying to himself:</p>

<p>“What peerless beauty! No wonder Arthur Varian
lost his head!”</p>

<p>He felt like groaning aloud, his sudden home-coming
had precipitated him into such a tragic plight, for the
task that lay before him was most bitter.</p>

<p>He could not help from seeing the pride and resentment
in her eyes, and something moved him to say, apologetically:</p>

<p>“I dare say you have been vexed with me for staying
away so long, Cinthia; but I have been working for you,
trying to lay aside a little pile, so that you could enjoy
your young ladyhood. You shall have pretty gowns and
pleasures henceforth. Are you not glad?”</p>

<p>It cost him effort to say so much, but there was no
gratitude in his daughter’s proud face, only a mutinous
flash of the great dark eyes as she answered:</p>

<p>“I shall not need your belated kindness now.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” impatiently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[37]</span></p>

<p>“Haven’t you told him, Aunt Beck, about—about—Arthur?”
blushing vividly.</p>

<p>“Yes—yes, dear.”</p>

<p>Cinthia nodded her head at him with a mixture of
childish triumph and womanliness.</p>

<p>“You see,” she said, proudly, “I am going to be married
soon. I shall have a husband who will give me all
I want—even,” bitterly, “the love I have missed all my
life!” tears sparkling into her eyes under the curling
lashes.</p>

<p>He felt the keen reproach deeply, and exclaimed, gently
and sadly:</p>

<p>“Poor little Cinthia.”</p>

<p>“Not poor now,” she answered, quickly. “It is <em>rich</em>
Cinthia now—rich in Arthur’s love and the certainty of
a happy future.”</p>

<p>She meant to be scathing, poor, neglected, wounded
Cinthia, but she could never guess how the words cut
into his heart and tortured him with secret agony—he
who meant to lay her love and hopes in ruins, to blight all
the joys of her life by the exercise of a father’s privilege
of breaking her will.</p>

<p>But no shadow crossed his face, no trouble was apparent
in his manner as he laughed easily, and answered:</p>

<p>“Nonsense! you are scarcely more than a child yet—too
young to be dreaming of marriage. I shall send you to
school to complete your education before you can begin
to think of lovers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[38]</span></p>

<p>“I will not go!” she said rebelliously, with startled
eyes upon his inscrutable face.</p>

<p>“Cinthy!” reproved her aunt.</p>

<p>“I will <em>not</em> go!” the girl repeated, defiantly. “I shall
marry Arthur, as I promised, before Christmas!”</p>

<p>She sprung from her seat and rushed to the window,
drumming tempestuously upon the pane, her habit
when greatly excited.</p>

<p>Outside the prospect was dreary. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i> of yesterday’s
storm littered the ground, the limbs of some of the
trees hung broken, the sun was hidden under clouds that
hinted at snow.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flint whispered to her brother, apprehensively:</p>

<p>“I told you so. She has a rebellious will, and she
thinks you have no authority over her now, because you
stayed away so long.”</p>

<p>“She will find out better about that before long,” he
answered, decisively, though the curious paleness of last
night settled again upon his handsome face.</p>

<p>He went over and stood by Cinthia’s side.</p>

<p>“It will snow before to-morrow,” he said, quietly.</p>

<p>“Yes;” and she looked around at him with a flushed
face, crying: “Oh, papa, you were jesting?”</p>

<p>“No. I can not give you to Arthur Varian, Cinthia.
You must forget him, my dear child.”</p>

<p>“I can not, will not! I should die without him!” passionately.</p>

<p>“No, no, you will soon get over this fancy, for you<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
have known Mr. Varian but a little time, and to-morrow
I shall take you away from this place, and amid new surroundings
you will forget the face that dazzled you here.”</p>

<p>“I will never forget Arthur, nor will I go away!” she
protested.</p>

<p>“You can not set at naught a father’s authority, Cinthia.”</p>

<p>“I disclaim it, I defy it! You have given me neither
love nor care, so you forfeit every right! Oh, I am sorry
you ever came back here!” stormed the angry girl.</p>

<p>“Cinthy, Cinthy, come and help me with the work!”
her aunt called, sharply; and she left him with the mien
of an offended princess.</p>

<p>He took refuge in a cigar, and smoked moodily, till the
click of the gate-latch made him look up, with a face
working with emotion, at a handsome, elegantly clad
young man walking up to the door.</p>

<p>Cinthia had gone upstairs to make the beds, and her
aunt went to admit the caller.</p>

<p>In a minute she ushered him into the little sitting-room,
saying nervously:</p>

<p>“Mr. Varian—my brother, Mr. Dawn.”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“THE FATES FORBID IT.”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Arthur Varian gave a slight start of surprise as he was
presented to Mr. Dawn, but the latter, more prepared for
the encounter, bowed with gracious courtesy, frankly
shook hands with the visitor, and pushed forward a chair.</p>

<p>Then they looked at each other silently a moment, and
that glance prepossessed each in favor of the other—a
natural sequence for Arthur, since he guessed that his
new acquaintance must be Cinthia’s father.</p>

<p>They conversed several moments on indifferent subjects,
both rather grave and constrained, with a feeling of
something serious in the air, then Arthur came to the
point with manly frankness:</p>

<p>“I have found you here most opportunely this morning,
Mr. Dawn. I came to see Mrs. Flint on a particular subject,
but of course you are the proper person to consult,”
ingratiatingly.</p>

<p>“Cinthia has already told me of your suit for her hand,
Mr. Varian,” gently helping him out, as if anxious for it
to be over.</p>

<p>“You know, then, that I love your daughter—that she
has promised me her hand. I can give you every assurance,
sir, of my possession of those requisites every good
man wishes to find in a suitor for his daughter. I am
rich, of the best blood of the South, my character irreproachable.
May I hope to have your approval?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[41]</span></p>

<p>He spoke diffidently, yet eagerly and with superb manliness,
his dark-blue eyes shining with hope, his cheek
glowing with honest pride that he had so much to offer
to the lady of his choice. Without vanity, he knew that
he was, in worldly parlance, an eligible <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parti</i>. No thought
of refusal crossed his mind.</p>

<p>Yet Everard Dawn was slow in replying to what many
might have considered a compliment.</p>

<p>His eyes rested steadily and gravely on Cinthia’s lover,
while his cheek paled to an ashen hue, and the hand that
rested on his knee trembled as with an ague chill.</p>

<p>Arthur Varian noticed these signs of deep agitation,
and attributed them to parental love. He added, gently:</p>

<p>“It seems cruel to harass you, almost in the first moment
of your return, with this matter; but it is not as if I
proposed taking Cinthia away from you immediately.
We had planned for a Christmas wedding.”</p>

<p>“This is the first of November, Mr. Varian,” he reminded
him, coldly.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; so it would be almost two months before I
took Cinthia away,” smilingly.</p>

<p>“My daughter is too young to marry yet. I came home
to place her at a convent school in Canada for two years,
not dreaming that she had notions of lovers in her childish
head,” Everard Dawn continued, gravely.</p>

<p>“You see, sir, we have made other plans,” said Arthur,
lightly, not taking him <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au serieux</i>.</p>

<p>To his surprise, Mr. Dawn answered, frigidly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[42]</span></p>

<p>“Of course, those plans made without my consent do
not carry.”</p>

<p>Arthur began to grow excited by the portentous gravity
of the other. He exclaimed, almost pleadingly:</p>

<p>“Mr. Dawn, you do not surely mean that you will make
me wait two years for Cinthia?”</p>

<p>And to his utter horror and despair, the gentleman replied
slowly, sadly, and gravely, as if every word cost
him a pang:</p>

<p>“No, I do not wish you to wait for Cinthia, Arthur
Varian, for the truth may as well be known to you first
as last, cruel as it must seem at first. Believe me, I am
sorry for your disappointment, and I hope your fancy
for Cinthia has not taken very deep root, for—she can
never be your wife.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Dawn!”</p>

<p>Arthur Varian sprung to his feet, and faced the speaker,
with such a grief and amazement on his handsome face as
might have melted the sternest heart.</p>

<p>“Mr. Dawn, you can not surely mean this refusal!
What reasons could exist for deliberately wrecking two
fond, loving hearts?”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, the reasons exist; but such as they
are, I can not explain them, Mr. Varian.”</p>

<p>Arthur cried out, eagerly:</p>

<p>“If you are offended at my impatience to claim Cinthia
for my own, I will agree to wait the two years you
mentioned, or even more. Nay, so deep and constant is<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
my love, that I would rather serve seven years for her,
as Jacob did for Rachel, than lose the dear hope of winning
her at last for my own.”</p>

<p>Everard Dawn rose from his chair, and grasping the
back, to still the great trembling of his frame, answered,
with passionate energy:</p>

<p>“Arthur Varian, there can never be a marriage between
you and my daughter. The fates forbid it, the unknown
forces that control your life and hers cry out upon it.
You must forget each other, for your love is the most ill-fated
and hopeless the world ever knew. Arguments
and entreaties are alike useless. You will believe that I
am in terrible earnest when I tell you that I would sooner
see my daughter dead than give her to you as a bride.”</p>

<p>“This is strange—passing strange, Mr. Dawn,” the
young man uttered, indignantly, yet still not as angrily as
might have been expected.</p>

<p>A subtle something about the man, with his grave, sad,
handsome visage, claimed his respectful admiration, in
spite of the mystery that surrounded his rejection of his
daughter’s suitor.</p>

<p>“It is strange, but true,” answered Everard Dawn,
wearily; and he added: “Do not let us prolong this most
painful conversation. Nothing can change the decrees of
relentless fate.”</p>

<p>Arthur felt himself politely dismissed, and turned toward
the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[44]</span></p>

<p>“You will at least permit me a parting interview with
Cinthia?” he murmured.</p>

<p>“You must forego it. It is better so. To-morrow she
leaves this place with me forever. Your two lives must
never cross again!”</p>

<p>With a heart full of pain, and anger, and silent rebellion,
the young man bowed, and walked out of the house;
but ere he reached the gate, he heard flying footsteps behind
him, and turned to greet Cinthia, bareheaded and
breathless, her cheeks pale, the tears hanging on the curly
fringe of her dark lashes.</p>

<p>She clasped her tiny hands around his arm, reckless
of her father’s eyes watching disapprovingly from the
window, and murmured:</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“He refuses his consent, Cinthia, and says he will take
you away to-morrow where we shall never meet again.”</p>

<p>“Arthur, you will never let him do it; you will not forsake
me if you love me!” wildly, passionately.</p>

<p>“My darling, you know I can not live without you!
Would you elope with me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” she began, eagerly; but just then her
father appeared at the door.</p>

<p>“Cinthia, you must come in out of the cold!” he called,
sternly; and Arthur said:</p>

<p>“Go, my darling!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A DARK SECRET.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Cinthia did not obey. She only clung closer to her
sorrowing lover.</p>

<p>“Oh, Arthur, don’t leave me! Take me home with
you to your sweet, kind mother! I hate that man!” she
sobbed in wild <em>abandon</em>.</p>

<p>Her father came down the walk toward them, and
Arthur bent and whispered rapidly in her ear:</p>

<p>“Go in with him now, my own sweet love, for we can
not defy him openly, we can only defeat him by strategy.
Be brave, darling, for—I will come for you and take you
away to-night.”</p>

<p>He kissed her, in spite of Mr. Dawn’s great eyes, and
pushed her from him with gentle violence just as her
father came out and took her hand.</p>

<p>“Come, Cinthia,” he said, with gentle firmness, and
she followed, though she shook off his touch as though it
had been a viper.</p>

<p>“Don’t touch me! I hate you—hate you!” she cried,
like a little fury, her eyes flashing fire. “Do you think
I will go with you to-morrow? Never—never! You
have made my life empty of joy, and now you envy the
sunshine that love has brought me! But you shall not
part me from Arthur—no, no, no!” and desperately sobbing,
she flung herself face downward on the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[46]</span></p>

<p>He sought Mrs. Flint in terrible perturbation.</p>

<p>“Come, she is in hysterics!” he exclaimed, anxiously.</p>

<p>“I told you it would go hard with Cinthy,” she answered,
curtly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I feared she would grieve; but, good Heaven!
she is a little fury—all rage and rebellion, swearing she
will not go with me to-morrow. She must be closely
watched to-day, for there is no telling what such a desperate
girl may do,” he said in alarm mixed with anger.</p>

<p>“Pshaw! she will simmer down when her fit of crying
is over. I’ll get her upstairs and give her a soothing
dose. Her temper-fits never last long, for Cinthy is a
good child, after all, and I am sorry over her disappointment,
she sets such store by love,” returned the old
woman, in real sympathy for the girl and secret disapproval
of his cold attitude to his neglected daughter.</p>

<p>He felt the implied reproach and answered, in weary
self-excuse:</p>

<p>“Rebecca, I know you think me hard and cold, but
my heart seems dead within me.”</p>

<p>“That is no excuse for neglect of duty,” she answered
with telling effect as she went to the difficult task of
soothing Cinthia and getting her upstairs to her room.</p>

<p>“A bitter home-coming!” he muttered, as he went
out into the bleak morning air, with its scurrying flakes
of threatening snow, to try to walk off some of his perturbation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[47]</span></p>

<p>Somehow the dreary day dragged through to the
drearier late afternoon.</p>

<p>Upstairs, Cinthia lay still and exhausted upon the bed
after such a day of tears, and sobs, and passionate rebellion
as Mrs. Flint hoped never to go through again.</p>

<p>Everard Dawn took his hat and great-coat, and set
out for another long walk—this time in the direction of
Arthur Varian’s home.</p>

<p>Had he repented his harshness? Was he going to
recall Cinthia’s banished lover?</p>

<p>The air was keen with a biting east wind, the sky
was gray with threatening clouds, and occasional light
scurries of snow flew in his face and flecked his thick
brown beard as he stepped briskly along, gazing over the
low evergreen hedge at the beautiful grounds of the
fine old estate he had refused for his daughter.</p>

<p>As he almost paused in his walk to gaze with deep interest
at the picturesque old stone house, he saw a lady
come out of a side-door and turn into an avenue of tall
dark cedars that made a pleasant promenade, shutting
off the rigorous wind very effectively.</p>

<p>He followed her progress with wistful eyes and tense
lips.</p>

<p>It was indeed the stately mistress of the mansion.
Wearying of its warmth and luxury, she had come out,
wrapped in sealskin, for her favorite constitutional along
the cedar avenue.</p>

<p>She walked slowly, with her hands behind her, and<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
her large, flashing dark eyes bent on the ground, as if
in profound thought.</p>

<p>Everard Dawn gazed eagerly after Mrs. Varian till
she was lost to view among the cedars, then, searching
for a gate in the hedge, he entered and turned his steps
toward the avenue, so as to meet her on her lonely walk.</p>

<p>Slowly they came on toward each other, the echo of
their footsteps dulled by the carpet of dead leaves, dank
and sodden with last night’s rain, and the face of the
man, with its gleaming eyes and deep pallor, bore signs
of unusual agitation.</p>

<p>Suddenly the lowering clouds parted, and a dull sunset
glow sent gleams of light down through the cedar
boughs upon the sodden path. The woman lifted her
large, passionate orbs to the sky.</p>

<p>Then she stopped short and uttered a startled cry.</p>

<p>She had caught sight of the advancing man, the intruder
upon her grounds.</p>

<p>He removed his hat and stood bowing before her in
the dying sunset glow, the light shining on his pallid
face and the streaks of gray in his thick locks.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Varian!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Everard Dawn!” she answered, in a hollow voice,
and her eyes glowed like live coals among dead embers,
so ashy-pale was her beautiful face.</p>

<p>Pressing her gloved hand upon her side, as if her
heart’s wild throbbings threatened to suffocate her, she
<a id="Ref_48" href="#BRef_48">called</a>, hoarsely:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[49]</span></p>

<p>“Why are you here? How dare you face me,
traitor?”</p>

<p>“I have not come to forgive you, Mrs. Varian, be
sure of <em>that</em>!” he answered, sternly.</p>

<p>“You do well to talk of forgiveness—<em>you</em>!” she
sneered, stamping the ground with her dainty foot.</p>

<p>“And—you—madame—would—do—well to crave it—not
that it would ever be granted you, remember. Only
angels could forgive injuries like mine!” the man answered,
stormily, with upraised hand, as if longing to
strike her down in her defiant beauty.</p>

<p>She did not shrink nor blanch, but her face was a picture
of emotional rage, dead white against the setting of
satin-black tresses and rich seal fur, her eyes flashing
as only great oriental black eyes can flash, and her rare
beauty of form showing to advantage as she drew herself
haughtily erect, hissing out:</p>

<p>“Go, Everard Dawn! Take your hated form from
my sight ere I summon my servants to drive you from
the grounds!”</p>

<p>Turning, as if to put her threat into execution, she was
arrested by a stern voice that said significantly:</p>

<p>“It is more to your interest to listen to me one moment,
Mrs. Varian.”</p>

<p>She whirled back toward him again, saying, imperiously:</p>

<p>“Be brief, then, Everard Dawn, for you should know<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
that it suffocates me to breathe the same air with such
as you!”</p>

<p>Evidently there was some strange secret between this
haughty pair, for he flashed her a glance of kindling
scorn, as he returned:</p>

<p>“What I have to say needs but one sentence to assure
you of its importance. Your son, Mrs. Varian, wishes
to wed—<em>my daughter</em>!”</p>

<p>A hoarse, strangled cry, and she fell back against the
trunk of a tree, clasping its great bole, as if to prevent
herself from falling. Her face wore such a look of
agony as if he had plunged a knife into her heart.</p>

<p>Everard Dawn impetuously started forward, as if to
catch her in his arms—the natural impulse of manhood
at seeing a woman suffer.</p>

<p>Then he suddenly remembered himself, and drew
haughtily back, waiting for her to speak again; but she
was silent several moments, gazing at him with the reproachful
eyes of a wounded animal at bay.</p>

<p>Then she gasped, faintly:</p>

<p>“Is she—is she—that Cinthia Dawn?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Cinthia Dawn is my daughter,” finishing the
unended sentence. “She lives here with my sister, and
I came home last night, after being self-exiled for weary
years, and found Arthur Varian and Cinthia plighted
lovers. I have forbidden their love, and sent him away;
but they are defiant and rebellious. I shall take her away<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
to-morrow—but in the meantime I came to you, for you
must help me to keep them apart.”</p>

<p>“I—oh, Heaven! what is there I can do?” she moaned,
in piteous distress.</p>

<p>He looked at her in dead silence a moment, then answered,
firmly:</p>

<p>“Cinthia is only a tender girl, and I will not have her
young life blasted with the hideous truth. Arthur is a
man, and if the dark secret that comes between their love
must ever be divulged, it is to him alone it need be revealed.
Will you charge yourself with this duty should
he persist in his resolve to marry Cinthia?”</p>

<p>“If you asked me for all my fortune, I would rather
give it you—but you are right. The duty is mine. I
will not shirk it, though it slay me. Poor, poor Arthur!”</p>

<p>“That is well. I shall depend on you to curb his
passion. Farewell, Mrs. Varian;” and with a lingering
glance, he turned away just as the last sun-ray glimmered
and faded in the west.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A BUNCH OF ROSES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Cinthia had never spent such an unhappy day in the
whole of her young life. She could not realize that only
yesterday she had been railing at the monotony of existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[52]</span></p>

<p>It was only twenty-four hours later, and a tragedy of
woe had overwhelmed her in its grim embrace.</p>

<p>Only yesterday she had been planning, and hoping,
and wishing for some way to know Arthur Varian better,
and now he was won, now he was her promised husband;
and through all the bitterness of her father’s
cruelty, that thought made glad her warm heart.</p>

<p>She had shed little rivers of tears, she had sulked at
her father and aunt, she had refused to eat her dinner,
and pouted among the pillows all day long; but through
it all ran one thrilling thought, Arthur was coming to
take her away to-night. He had promised, and she knew
he would keep his word.</p>

<p>When her aunt went down about her household duties,
she laughed to herself at the thought of outwitting those
two—her cold-hearted aunt and her cruel father. The
thought of their surprise, when they should find her gone
in the morning was pure delight.</p>

<p>“There he goes now. I wish he would go and stay
forever!” she cried, petulantly, as she heard the gate-latch
click, and springing to the window, saw her father
walking away into the gloomy distance.</p>

<p>She sat down and watched him out of sight, adding:</p>

<p>“He is very handsome and noble looking, and if he
had treated me better, I should have learned to love him
well. But now I hate and fear him, and I would die
before I would go with him to-morrow. Dear,<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
dear <a id="Ref_53" href="#BRef_53">Arthur</a>, I hope nothing will prevent him from taking me
away to-night.”</p>

<p>And while she was moping, her aunt came up with a
magnificent bunch of roses, saying kindly:</p>

<p>“Cheer up now, Cinthy! Here’s a splendid big nosegay
for you, and a box of French candy. I ’spose your
pa sent it, because he went down into the town a while
ago, and said he’d get you a present.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want any of his presents! Take them away!”
Cinthia answered, angrily.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a little fool, Cinthy. I’m getting out of patience
with your airs,” Mrs. Flint returned, severely,
putting down the gifts and slamming the door as she
stalked out.</p>

<p>Cinthia loved flowers dearly, and the scent of the roses
wooed her to caress them presently, burying her face in
the fragrant red and white beauties.</p>

<p>A note hidden among them scratched the tip of her
nose, and she drew it out with a cry of wonder.</p>

<p>It was from Arthur Varian, and ran thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have thought it all over, darling, and I think the
only way for us is to elope to Washington to-night and
be married. I do not like to steal a man’s daughter away
from him this way, but his obstinacy leaves us no other
hope, and as there is really no reason to prevent our marrying,
I hope he will soon be reconciled. No doubt,
mother will help us to bring him around afterward, she
is so very clever. And I shall not let her into the secret
of to-night, so that he can not accuse her of connivance<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
in our plans. I will be waiting near your house with a
carriage at twelve o’clock to-night, and you must slip
out and join me. Then it is only two miles to the station,
and away we go on the midnight train to Washington.
Keep up your courage, my sweet love, for we are
going to be the happiest pair in the world.</p>

<p class="ir1">“<span class="smcap">Arthur.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>Cinthia refused to go down to supper, and made a
meal of sweetmeats. The hours between dark and midnight
seemed endless. She heard her aunt retire to her
room at an early hour, and her father later on. The
house was wrapped for an hour in profound silence, then
she heard the hall-clock chiming twelve.</p>

<p>Cinthia was all ready, even to her hat and jacket, her
face pale with eagerness, her heart throbbing wildly.
She stepped to the door and turned the knob. Horrors!
it did not yield to her touch. They had suspected her and
locked her into the room.</p>

<p>An impulse came to her to shriek aloud in her wrath
and defiance, and to try and batter down the door and
escape; but a timely thought restrained her, and she drew
back from the temptation, her eyes flaming luridly, her
temper raging.</p>

<p>“They shall not baffle us, the cunning wretches! Arthur,
my love, I am coming to you, though the whole
world oppose!” she cried, wildly, rushing to the window
and throwing up the sash.</p>

<p>It had been snowing steadily for hours, though she<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
did not know it. As she leaned out into the darkness a
great gust of wind and big swirling flakes of snow
stormed into the room, blowing out the light and clasping
her in a cold embrace.</p>

<p>The night was black as Erebus, the wind cut like a
knife, and the air was full of blinding snow that must
have been falling for hours, it was banked so heavily
against the window-ledge, almost freezing Cinthia’s hands
as they plunged into it on leaning forward, for though
she gasped and caught her breath as the wild elements
blew in her face and tried to beat her back, she did not
recoil from her fixed purpose, which was to drop out
upon the top of the porch and climb down to the ground
by the aid of a honeysuckle vine that wreathed over the
trellis frame at one end. The icy blast that shrieked in
her ears was not enough to chill the fiery ardor of her
resentment at her father, and the yearning of her heart<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
for the dear lover from whom she feared to be separated
forever.</p>

<p>Her tender young heart went out to him with an intensity
of feeling as she peered out into the stormy darkness
of the night, wondering if he was there waiting, and if he
was growing impatient at her delay.</p>

<p>“Ah, my love,” she murmured, impetuously, “I am
coming to you—coming! Neither bolts nor bars, nor
storm nor darkness, nor anything under Heaven, shall
keep us apart!”</p>

<p>The wind whistled past the eaves and seemed to take
on an almost human voice of sorrowing, as though it
echoed those dismal words: “Shall keep us apart, shall
keep us apart!”</p>

<p>Cinthia caught her breath and listened, it was so
strange, that almost human wail of the wind sighing
through the great pine tree on the corner. It seemed to
be sobbing: “Apart, apart!”</p>

<p>“How mournful it sounds!” she uttered, in an awe-stricken
tone; then she climbed through the window and
dropped with a dull thud out on the porch. Mrs. Flint
heard the sound in her adjoining room, and muttered,
drowsily:</p>

<p>“It is the snow sliding down from off the roof.”</p>

<p>Cinthia crawled to edge of the porch, and felt out
carefully for the thick mat of the honeysuckle.</p>

<p>She knew she was making a desperate venture, but she<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
said to herself, bitterly, that desperate emergencies require
desperate remedies.</p>

<p>With infinite care and patience she managed to get
hold of the strong matted vines, and swung herself carefully
over the trellis, beginning to make the perilous descent
with bated breath, for a fall might mean a broken
limb, or, at the least, a sprained ankle.</p>

<p>The wet snow clung to her face and garments and
chilled her to the bone; but she persevered, though the
high wind threatened to loosen her hold and blow her
down every instant. What did she care for it all, poor
Cinthia fleeing from her dull life and her hated persecutors
to the tender arms of love? She would endure
anything rather than be cheated of her happiness.</p>

<p>The cold snow flecked her benumbed face and hands,
the high wind swung her light form to and fro like a
flower upon the vine, her breath seemed to freeze on her
lips, but her courage never flagged. Out there in the
night and the storm her lover was waiting. The thought
kept her young heart warm.</p>

<p>She was more than half-way down now, and the wind
began to lull. Courage, Cinthia; the danger will soon
be over, sweetheart, and love rewarded for its brave
struggles.</p>

<p>But, alas! how often bathos overcomes pathos.</p>

<p>Cinthia was only a girl, after all, with the usual feminine
attributes.</p>

<p>As she swung herself carefully from branch to branch<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
of the vine, hoping and longing for her feet to touch
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra firma</i>, yet sustained by unfaltering courage, there
came to her a sudden wild and terrifying thought that
made the blood run colder in her veins than all the
raging storm had force to do.</p>

<p>She had remembered that of late the immense vine to
which she clung had afforded a delightful gymnasium for
a score or so of large rodents, causing her aunt to
threaten to cut it down.</p>

<p>The feminine mind has one idiosyncrasy known of all
men, and accordingly ridiculed, but never overcome. Cinthia
did not pretend to be stronger than her sex. With
that sudden terrifying thought an uncontrollable shriek
burst from her lips, her numb hands relaxed their grasp,
and she went crashing down through space plump into a
great, great bank of drifted snow blown into a heap below
the vine.</p>

<p>Everard Dawn heard that shriek as he tossed on his
pillow in restless dreams, and suddenly raised his head.</p>

<p>“What a night!” he cried, for he had been watching
the storm ere he retired. “How the wind howls to-night,
shrieking like a human voice through that splendid
pine on the corner! How I used to love the wind in the
pines in my far Southern home until—<em>afterward</em>! But
since then it is an embodied grief to me, as in the plaint of
one of our Southern poets:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[59]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘I hear the wind in the pines</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">With its soughing of wordless woe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And the whisper of leafless vines,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Like a sad heart’s overflow.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Sigh on! they seem to say,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Sigh on, sad heart, to the night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For the world is cold and gray,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And life has no delight.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He listened with his head on his arm but the wind
had lulled for the moment, and the strangely human
shriek he had heard began to affect him very unpleasantly.</p>

<p>“Was it really the wind?” he began to ask himself,
wondering if it might not be an hysterical shriek of his
rebellious daughter.</p>

<p>“Poor little Cinthia, God help her!” he uttered, sadly,
and rising from his bed, began to dress hurriedly. “I
will go and see if there is anything wrong,” he muttered.</p>

<p>He had been very angry when he returned at dusk from
his strange interview with the scornful Mrs. Varian, and
heard from his worried sister about the flowers and
candy she had taken up to Cinthia.</p>

<p>“How is my little girl now?” he asked, anxiously, and
started when she replied:</p>

<p>“She is in a dreadful temper, and when I took up the
flowers and candy you sent her, she ordered me to throw
them away.”</p>

<p>“Did you do it?”</p>

<p>“No; I told her not to be a little fool, put them down
on the table, and came away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[60]</span></p>

<p>“Rebecca, I fear you have made a grave mistake. I
did not send Cinthia anything. I intended to purchase a
gift for her, but—I was—so troubled—I quite forgot it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Flint studied a moment, then frankly admitted
that the boy who brought the flowers had not said Mr.
Dawn sent them, in fact, had merely said, “For Miss
Cinthia,” and she had jumped at the conclusion that they
came from her brother.</p>

<p>“They must have come from Arthur Varian. I take
this very ill of him after what I said to him this morning,”
angrily. “Are you sure,” he continued, “that no
letter accompanied the flowers?”</p>

<p>“I did not see any,” the old lady replied, uneasily.</p>

<p>Everard Dawn was more versed in the ways of romantic
lovers than his prosaic sister, so he said, with a
troubled air:</p>

<p>“You may be sure that a sentimental note accompanied
the gift, and they may possibly have planned an elopement
this very night. I desire that you will lock her door on
the outside without her knowledge when you retire to-night.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” she replied, and obeyed him to the letter.</p>

<p>Recalling all this, the thought came to him that perhaps
Cinthia, finding her door locked, was indulging herself
in a fit of hysterics.</p>

<p>“God help us all,” he sighed, as he finished dressing;
and, taking his night-lamp, stole upstairs to listen outside
her door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[61]</span></p>

<p>But all was still as death at first, then the wind rose
again, and he heard strange noises within the room. It
was, in fact, the wind rushing through the window and
banging things about in confusion.</p>

<p>He went and tapped on Mrs. Flint’s door, and she soon
confronted him in her cap and gown, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“I thought I heard creaking steps in the hall. What
is the matter? Are you ill, Everard?”</p>

<p>“No; but I fancied I heard strange noises from Cinthia’s
room. Did you notice anything?”</p>

<p>“I heard the snow sliding off the roof, and the wind
shrieking in the branches of that great pine out there.
It always sounds so human in a storm, that I would cut
it down only that Deacon Flint set store by it. He said he
planted it when he was a little boy. But I will go in and
peep at Cinthia just to ease your mind, Everard. ’Sh-h!
we must not wake her if she is asleep,” turning the knob
with a cautious hand and opening wide the door.</p>

<p>Whew! how the cold air rushed in her face and thrust
her back. By the light that Everard carried she saw the
window wide open and the snow-flakes flying in on the
carpet.</p>

<p>“Why, how strange that the window should be open.
Cinthia must be crazy. Wait till I shut it, Everard, and
bring in the light,” she ejaculated.</p>

<p>He obeyed, and when he entered, they saw what had
happened. The room was empty and Cinthia was gone.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flint could not believe it at first. She ran all<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
about the room, and then all over the house, crying in
wild dismay:</p>

<p>“Cinthia! Cinthia! Cinthia! where are you hiding,
honey?”</p>

<p>But no reply came back, and very soon the unhappy
father found out the truth. She had actually escaped by
way of the window. Securing a lantern from the kitchen,
he went out for a short while, and returned with a very
accurate report.</p>

<p>She had slid down the honeysuckle vine to the ground,
and there were tracks in the snow leading to a sleigh
that had been in waiting not far away. The marks of the
runners were quite distinct, in spite of the drifting snow.</p>

<p>“She has eloped with Arthur Varian. I must follow
and bring them back,” he said, with terrible calmness.</p>

<p>“Yes, for I found the letter that must have come with
the flowers blowing about the floor of her room,” she answered,
giving it to him.</p>

<p>He read it, groaned bitterly, and thrust it into his
pocket.</p>

<p>“I must pursue them,” he said again. “Tell me where
to find <a id="Ref_62" href="#BRef_62">the</a> nearest livery stable, Rebecca.”</p>

<p>“It is half a mile,” she said, giving him clear directions,
but adding: “Oh, Everard, you will not venture out in
such a storm. You may catch your death of cold!”</p>

<p>“You know not what you talk of, my sister. I would
rather catch my death, as you say, than permit Arthur
Varian to marry Cinthia Dawn!” he hurled back at her,<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>
hoarsely, as he rushed from the house out into the night
and storm.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">CINTHIA’S ELOPEMENT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Meanwhile Cinthia’s fall and shriek had been heard by
other alert ears—no less than Arthur Varian’s, who had
been waiting impatiently in the shadow of the trees for
ten minutes, wondering whether Cinthia would come or
not, fearing lest the fury of the storm should daunt her
courage and hold her back.</p>

<p>With his eager eyes on her window, he presently saw
the sash fly up and Cinthia’s beautiful face and form outlined
against the background of the lighted room. The
next moment the gale blew in and extinguished the lamp
and darkened the beautiful picture.</p>

<p>But in that moment he saw enough to relieve his fears.
Cinthia wore her hat and jacket ready for traveling. She
was coming to him, his brave little darling, and out yonder
waited a swift horse and sleigh, and plenty of cozy buffalo
robes to shelter her from the cold in their swift drive
to the station.</p>

<p>He advanced to the gate and stood with his eyes fixed
on the door, eager to give her a joyous welcome when
she appeared, lest the thick darkness frighten her back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[64]</span></p>

<p>Then his ears caught the soft thud on the top of the
porch, and, like Mrs. Flint, he thought at first it might
be snow sliding off the roof.</p>

<p>The wind arose with a great bang and clatter among
the loose shutters, deadening the sound of the branches
as Cinthia swung herself off the vine and began her descent
to the ground, while her eager lover strained his eyes
through the thick darkness, watching the door to see her
come.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the wind lulled so that he could catch
his breath, and he heard a soft rustling in the vines, as
if they strained under a dead weight.</p>

<p>“Heavens! what is that?” he muttered, with a half
suspicion of the truth; and, tearing open the gate, he
rushed across the yard through the wet, impeding snow,
already half a foot deep, to the corner of the house just
as Cinthia shrieked and fell into the little bank of drifted
snow so soft and cold.</p>

<p>With a bound, Arthur was by her side, stretching out
eager hands, crying, in a passion of love and grief:</p>

<p>“Cinthia, dearest, are you hurt?”</p>

<p>He reached down and gathered her up like a child in
his strong arms.</p>

<p>“Oh, my love—my treasure! What a terrible risk you
ran for me! Tell me if you are hurt!”</p>

<p>She whispered nervously against his breast:</p>

<p>“I don’t think I am, only frightened almost to death. I
thought—thought—every bone—would be broken—but<span class="pagenum">[65]</span>
the snow was as soft as a feather bed! Oh, let us get
away, Arthur, before they hear us! You may carry me
if you will—I am trembling <em>so</em>,” her teeth chattering so
that she could scarcely speak.</p>

<p>“That’s what I meant to do,” Arthur replied, managing
to find her face somehow in the darkness and imprint
a kiss upon it ere he strode away with her to the
sleigh, and tucked her in among the robes so that not a
breath of cold could reach her, while he kept up her
courage with the tenderest words, assuring her that she
should never repent trusting herself to him.</p>

<p>“Oh, how dark it is! How shall you find your way
along the dark country road?” she cried in alarm.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see my sleigh-lamps? Besides, I know the
road well. I shall have to drive slowly, but that will not
matter, as there is no one in pursuit, and the train is not
due till one o’clock,” returned Arthur, confidently, as he
seated himself, took the reins, and chirruped to his fleet
pony.</p>

<p>Cinthia snuggled up to his side, and sobbed and
laughed hysterically till he almost exhausted the whole
vocabulary of love-words before she said:</p>

<p>“Oh, Arthur, I must tell you why I fell, and you will
not call me your brave little heroine any more, but only
the greatest coward in the world!”</p>

<p>And the wicked young elopers, flying through the storm
and darkness of night toward the happy haven of marriage,
laughed together till they almost forgot their surroundings<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
at Cinthia’s sudden fear, while vowing but a
moment before to fly to Arthur though the whole world
oppose.</p>

<p>“To be frightened at the thought of a rat—not <em>at</em> a
rat, but just the bare thought of touching one lurking in
the vines—was it not utterly ridiculous?” she queried,
though not at all sure but that she would do the same
thing again.</p>

<p>Arthur could only laugh at her confession, and rejoice
that she had sustained no hurt from her fall, so they sped
along through the night and storm, each very, very happy
in their youthful love, and confident of forgiveness from
the obdurate father when he should learn that they were
married.</p>

<p>“We shall be in Washington by breakfast-time to-morrow,
and we’ll go at once to a minister and have the ceremony
over. Then we will telegraph your father and my
mother that we are one, and that we shall spend our
honey-moon North,” said the young man, planning everything
happily without a thought of failure.</p>

<p>“Papa will be simply furious!” laughed Cinthia; “but
he can not take me away from you and send me off to
school, thank Heaven, as he proposed to do. And as
for his forgiveness, I feel quite indifferent to it. I don’t
care if I never see his face again. But your mother—what
will she say, Arthur? Perhaps she preferred for
you to marry some beautiful rich girl?” anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[67]</span></p>

<p>Arthur squeezed her to his side with one free arm, as
he replied, gayly:</p>

<p>“Don’t worry over that, love, for my mother was so
charmed with your beauty and sweetness last night, that
I felt sure she would be glad to have you for a daughter,
so I made bold to propose to you on the way to your
house, and told her all about it at breakfast this morning.
Dear heart, she has never crossed a wish of mine
since I was born, and she said I had taken her by surprise,
but she would give me her blessing, and did not
care how soon we set the wedding-day, it would be so
pleasant to have a young girl in the house. Was she not
a darling? So when I came to ask for your hand this
morning, and your father snubbed me so cruelly, I did
not have the heart to go back to her then, for I feared she
might not countenance an elopement, the Varians are so
proud. I stayed away, making arrangements for our
flitting, and sent her a note that I had gone off on a sudden
trip, and would wire particulars. But, bless you, she
will be all right when she hears we are married, though
she will never forgive your father for crossing the will
of her spoiled boy.”</p>

<p>Laughing and chatting happily in the joy of being together
they drove along very slowly, for fear of an accident,
and because Arthur thought they had plenty of time
to reach the station.</p>

<p>But suddenly and most inexplicably, the gentle little<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
pony began to balk, starting backward so quickly as to
almost throw the occupants out of the sleigh.</p>

<p>At the same time it began to neigh in a frightened
way, requiring all of Arthur’s skill to reassure it.</p>

<p>Trembling violently and neighing distressfully, it stood
still in the road, refusing to budge forward an inch.</p>

<p>“He is frightened, poor fellow, at some little obstruction
in the road. I had better get out and remove it,”
said Arthur, giving Cinthia the reins, and springing out
into the snow.</p>

<p>Giving the trembling pony a reassuring pat and word,
he passed him and went on to examine the road.</p>

<p>Cinthia heard him cry out in alarm and wonder as he
stooped down.</p>

<p>“Oh, what is it?” she exclaimed, curiously.</p>

<p>“Cinthia, there is a human being lying here unconscious
in the snow—a woman!”</p>

<p>“Oh, heavens!”</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” continued Arthur, distressfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, Arthur, we must take her into the sleigh with
us and carry her to the station! Oh, how terrible to fall
down unconscious in the snow on such a wild night!”
cried Cinthia, beginning to sob with sympathy, the cold
air turning the tears into pearls upon her cheeks.</p>

<p>Without more ado, Arthur dragged the inert form up
out of the snow, and staggering under the heavy weight
of a large, unconscious woman, managed to deposit his<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
burden in the bottom of the sleigh, after which he got in
himself, saying, as he took up the reins:</p>

<p>“I am sorry this happened, because it will draw upon us
undesirable notoriety at the station; but it can not be
helped now, and I must hasten on, for I have driven so
slowly that we have not much time to spare.”</p>

<p>But just as they started off, he caught the sudden
sound of sleigh bells and the neigh of a horse quickly
gaining on them, as a loud, angry voice thundered:</p>

<p>“Halt, or I fire! Choose death or instant surrender!”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">OUTWITTED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>As nearly hopeless as Everard Dawn’s pursuit of the
fugitives had appeared even to himself when he began it,
he had succeeded better than he could have expected.</p>

<p>His only hope had been to catch them at the station
before the arrival of the train; but, owing to Arthur’s
careful driving in the storm, and the stoppage to take in
the woman found unconscious in the road, he had overtaken
them while yet half a mile from the station.</p>

<p>He had run all the way to the livery stable, and as soon
as a sleigh was furnished, leaped in and drove off at the
highest speed possible in the condition of the weather, his
mind wrought to the highest tension of trouble, rendering<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
him unconscious of personal danger. As the horse trotted
briskly along, under the urging of voice and whip, the
light sleigh rocked from side to side, almost overturning
twice, but eventually gaining on Arthur’s horse, until he
perceived the stoppage in the road by the light that
streamed from Arthur’s lamps upon the snow.</p>

<p>He heard their voices blending with the wind, he saw
something lifted into the sleigh, and wondered if his
daughter had fallen out. Then, as Arthur leaped in and
chirruped to his pony, he rose in his seat and shouted
furiously:</p>

<p>“Halt, or I fire! Choose between death or instant surrender!”</p>

<p>And to emphasize his words, he instantly fired into
the air, making both their horses snort and rear with
terror.</p>

<p>Arthur’s only reply was to touch his horse with the
whip, making it bound furiously forward.</p>

<p>A most unequal race ensued, Arthur’s sleigh being encumbered
with the weight of three, while Mr. Dawn
was quite alone.</p>

<p>One, two, three minutes, and Mr. Dawn’s horse flashed
past Arthur’s. Then he drove across the front of the
road, shouting, hoarsely:</p>

<p>“Stop! There will be a collision!”</p>

<p>Cinthia had slipped down senseless in her seat, and
nothing but surrender was possible now. With a silent
curse at his evil fate, Arthur pulled the lines, forcing<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
his plunging pony to a stand-still, as Everard Dawn continued,
menacingly:</p>

<p>“I do not wish to harm you, Mr. Varian, but you must
give me back my daughter!”</p>

<p>Arthur felt like a coward, but he realized that no other
course was possible now. With a groan, he answered:</p>

<p>“I would rather part with my life than this dear girl,
Mr. Dawn. Oh, think a moment, before you sunder our
loving hearts, of the despair you are bringing into both
our lives!”</p>

<p>Everard Dawn drove back to the side of the sleigh
where Arthur waited, and said, sternly:</p>

<p>“Cinthia!”</p>

<p>“She is unconscious, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ah, then, it was Cinthia you lifted into the sleigh.
Is she hurt?”</p>

<p>“It was not Cinthia, but an unconscious woman I
found in the road.”</p>

<p>“If Cinthia is unconscious, so much the better. We
will have no scene with her in transferring her to my
charge, and she will not hear what I must say to you.”</p>

<p>“Speak on, sir,” Arthur answered most bitterly in his
keen resentment. And Mr. Dawn began:</p>

<p>“I think very hardly of you, Arthur Varian, for disregarding
my words to you this morning. I said frankly
to you that reasons of the gravest import forbid the marriage
of yourself and Cinthia.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[72]</span></p>

<p>“I had a right to be informed of those reasons, sir,”
Arthur said, hotly.</p>

<p>“Say you so? Then go to your mother, Arthur Varian,
and ask of her the reason why my daughter can never be
your wife!”</p>

<p>Arthur started in surprise that this man should know
aught of his mother, but answered, quickly:</p>

<p>“She can not know anything against it, since only this
morning she gave her pleased consent.”</p>

<p>“She knows better now; and I say again, go to her
and ask her for the truth,” replied Everard Dawn, as he
stepped out of the sleigh to take possession of Cinthia.</p>

<p>Arthur was before him. He lifted the inanimate form
in his arms, and kissed the cold, white face in despairing
love before he resigned her to the impatient father’s arms.</p>

<p>“Ah, you can not surely guess of what a priceless treasure
you are robbing me, Mr. Dawn! May Heaven judge
between us whether you have been merciful to me!” he
cried, reproachfully.</p>

<p>“I rest my cause with Heaven,” Mr. Dawn answered,
reverently, as he placed Cinthia in the sleigh, covered her
with warm robes, and drove away with a cold good-night
to the young man, who continued his course to the station
as fast as he could urge his horse to go.</p>

<p>In his agony of grief at losing his beautiful, promised
bride, and in hot resentment of what he deemed hardness
of heart in her father, Arthur Varian had yielded without<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
reflection upon the baseness of it, to a sudden, overmastering
temptation.</p>

<p>His caresses and emotion on handing the unconscious
woman to Mr. Dawn had been simply a superb bit of
acting. It was the poor waif of the road he had placed
in the arms of Everard Dawn, thus completely outwitting
the unhappy father while he drove rapidly on to the station,
hoping to board the train before his deception was
discovered.</p>

<p>In a moment the few scattering midnight lights of the
railway town began to appear, and Cinthia gasped and
opened her eyes, beginning to sob with alarm:</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, oh!”</p>

<p>“It is all right, darling. We have distanced our pursuers,”
said Arthur, cheerfully. “And here we are at
the station, and the train is coming. We have not time
to go into the waiting-room.”</p>

<p>He helped her out, and called a negro boy, to whom he
intrusted his sleigh, telling him to return it to Idlewild
next day, and pressing a liberal reward into his willing
hand.</p>

<p>Then he helped the bewildered Cinthia aboard the train
and led her at once to a stove, saying, tenderly:</p>

<p>“Warm yourself, my darling, while I try to secure seats
in the parlor car.”</p>

<p>“It is very unfortunate, indeed,” said the conductor,
“but the Pullman sleeper is crowded. Only one berth<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
was vacant when they came into the station, and it has
just been engaged by a lady <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> for New York.”</p>

<p>The lady had indeed just taken possession of her berth,
brushing haughtily past without taking notice of either.
Neither did Arthur notice her, or he would have seen with
surprise that it was his own mother. Deeply chagrined
that he could not get quarters for Cinthia in the parlor
car, he returned to her side, and they spent the hours
very happily till morning.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">OH, WHAT A NIGHT!</span></h2>
</div>


<p>All unconscious of the deception that had been practiced
on him, Everard Dawn drove briskly back to his
home, making no effort to restore Cinthia, and, in fact,
rather hoping that her unconsciousness would last until
he could place her in Mrs. Flint’s care. In common with
most men, he had a holy horror of sensational scenes, and
shrunk from hearing his daughter’s reproaches when she
should revive and find herself so cruelly sundered from
her lover.</p>

<p>So he made haste to reach home, and his thoughts on
the way were most sad and bitter, for in this man’s past
was a tragedy of sorrow that might have driven a weaker
man to cut loose the bonds of unbearable life with his own<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
hands and hurl himself recklessly into the great unknown
future beyond.</p>

<p>With his return to his sister’s house, everything had
rushed back upon him like the swell of some great river,
and seared wounds had been opened afresh, bleeding in
secret beneath his outward calmness. However handsome
and prosperous he appeared to the outward eye, no man
could have envied Everard Dawn, having looked once
into his tortured heart and seen its secrets laid bare.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flint was watching and listening for him, and as
soon as the sleigh stopped, she seized a lantern, and
bundling herself in a shawl, rushed out to the gate.</p>

<p>Springing out and fastening the lines to a post, he said,
triumphantly:</p>

<p>“I overtook them, Rebecca, and Cinthia fainted with
fear. I brought her back in that condition, thus escaping
a scene in the sleigh. I will carry her in, and you can
revive her at your leisure, while I return the sleigh to
the stable.”</p>

<p>He lifted out the form, carefully shrouded in a large,
warm robe, and, almost staggering under the burden, followed
the lead of his sister into the sitting-room, depositing
it on the long sofa, panting:</p>

<p>“Cinthia looked so slender, I did not suppose she was
so heavy. My arms fairly ache. Now do you revive her,
Rebecca, and soothe the poor girl as tenderly as you can
until I return presently.”</p>

<p>“Well, I declare, I never saw such an unfeeling<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
father in my life! There he rushes off again, without
so much as glancing at her face to see if she is dead or
alive. He doesn’t seem to bear one bit of love for the
poor, neglected girl, and I wish in my heart she had got
away with Arthur Varian and married him, that I do!”
ejaculated the old lady, as she heard her brother drive
away, her usually cold heart melting with sympathy for the
hapless girl over whom she bent, drawing aside the folds
of the heavy robe from her face, adding, sharply: “And
a pretty how-d’ye-do there’ll be when she revives and
finds herself parted from her lover. Not that I believe
he can <em>keep</em> them apart, for there’s an old saying that true
love always finds a way, and——Oh, my goodness gracious,
<em>what in the world</em>——!”</p>

<p>With that dismayed exclamation, the Widow Flint
dropped the corner of the robe, and recoiled as if she had
encountered a nest of serpents.</p>

<p>It was not quite so bad as that, but she certainly had
good reason for her surprise and dismay.</p>

<p>For instead of her beautiful niece, slender, golden-haired
Cinthia, there lay a large woman of middle age,
shabbily attired, with a pinched face, whose cadaverous
hue was outlined by long, straggling locks of jet-black
hair.</p>

<p>“Dead!” cried Mrs. Flint, in horror; and the shock
to her nerves was so great that she rushed from the
room and banged open the front door, calling wildly down
the road: “Everard! Everard! Come back!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[77]</span></p>

<p>But the homeless wind and vagrant snow blew mockingly
in her face, and no other sound came back, so she
knew it was all in vain to stand there shouting for one
who could not hear.</p>

<p>She went in and shut the door, groaning loudly:</p>

<p>“What a night—what a night—and what a mistake
Everard has made, or is he only playing a foolish joke
on me? Who is the woman, anyway? I never saw her
face in these parts before.”</p>

<p>And presently conquering her terror, she stole back into
the room for a second look.</p>

<p>The strange intruder lay there speechless, motionless,
as if life had indeed fled from her body. Mrs. Flint ventured
to touch her hand, and it felt like ice.</p>

<p>“She is frozen to death!” she muttered, pityingly.
“Oh, how I wish Everard would return and explain this
mysterious thing. I had better feel her heart. Why, it
seems to beat faintly, poor creature! I wish I knew just
what to do to bring her to life, for this is just awful!
<em>Oh, what a night!</em>”</p>

<p>But, leaving poor Mrs. Flint to her dazed condition and
perplexity, we must follow the eloping couple as their
train rushed on through the night and darkness to Washington.</p>

<p>They had spent several happy hours together on the
train, heedless of the other passengers, who mostly slept
or talked together, apparently taking slight notice of the
young pair who sat apart conversing with shy dignity<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
and permitting themselves no slightest caresses, such as
might have drawn ready ridicule upon their love.</p>

<p>Almost before they realized it, the day dawned, and
the train rushed into the city on time at eight o’clock.</p>

<p>Arthur took a carriage, and he and his bride to be were
driven to a hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, where he always
stopped when visiting the city.</p>

<p>Calling the proprietor aside, he said, in his most genial
fashion:</p>

<p>“As I have known you a long time, sir, I wish to say
that I desire to be married to the young lady who accompanies
me before I register our names. Can you send out
for the nearest minister?”</p>

<p>The host congratulated him, and answered laughingly:</p>

<p>“Cupid never was in such luck before, for the Reverend
Doctor Sprague is in the office at this moment,
having called in to inquire about a subscription for his
new church. You will both please step into the parlor,
and I will bring him there in a jiffy!”</p>

<p>Cinthia was all in a tremor now.</p>

<p>“Must I not even bathe my face and brush my hair
first?” she queried, clinging to him.</p>

<p>“No, love, not till the little ceremony is over. I can
not rest till I know you are mine and out of your father’s
power,” Arthur cried, ardently. “And, see, there is the
minister! Be brave, love; it will all be over in a moment.”</p>

<p>“Doctor Sprague—Mr. Varian and his intended bride.
I am to be the best man, and give the bride away,” said<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
the host, genially; and the minister bowed, and opened his
book, saying:</p>

<p>“I should like two witnesses, please. Perhaps that
lady looking out of the window will oblige us.”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">PARTED AT THE ALTAR.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Doctor Sprague, the minister, had noticed on entering
that a tall, stately lady in a long traveling-wrap stood
at one of the windows, looking down absently on the busy
avenue.</p>

<p>It was, in fact, Mrs. Varian, who had arrived but a
few minutes ago, and was waiting in the parlor until her
room should be made ready.</p>

<p>Tortured by a cruel unrest after her interview of the
evening before with Everard Dawn, she had decided to
leave Idlewild for a few days, until after he went away
with his daughter.</p>

<p>Her mind was quite easy over the breaking up of the
untoward love affair, as Arthur had written her a note
earlier in the day, saying he was off on a short trip with
a friend, and would wire particulars to-morrow.</p>

<p>On learning from Mr. Dawn that he had rejected Arthur’s
suit for his daughter’s hand, she guessed readily
enough that her boy had gone away to drown his sorrow.<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
She was glad of this, believing that change of scene
is a great panacea for hopeless grief.</p>

<p>Acting on this idea herself, she determined to make
a short journey to Washington, and perhaps New
York, in the hope of obliterating from her mind certain
painful impressions produced, or, rather, renewed on
it by the encounter with Everard Dawn at Idlewild.</p>

<p>The man’s face and voice haunted her and brought
back memories fraught with pain. To escape them,
she had fled from her home that stormy night to seek
“respite and nepenthe.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I would not dig my past</div>

    <div class="verse indent1">Its dreams that did not last.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Absorbed in painful thought, she had not observed
the entrance of any one until the raised voice of the
minister made her look over her shoulder in cold inquiry:</p>

<p>“I shall need two witnesses, please. Perhaps that
lady looking out of the window would oblige us.”</p>

<p>Then the host advanced toward her, saying, courteously:</p>

<p>“Madame, will you honor us by becoming the witness
to a ceremony of marriage?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Varian inclined her proud, dark head in assent,
and moved gracefully forward toward the young
couple who stood before the minister, the girl bashful
and trembling, the man pale, but with an eager smile
on his handsome face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[81]</span></p>

<p>The next moment a startled cry rang on the air.</p>

<p>“Arthur!”</p>

<p>The young man dropped Cinthia’s hand and looked
around.</p>

<p>“Mother!” in surprise.</p>

<p>“Oh, Arthur! what is the meaning of this strange
scene?” she cried, coming up between him and Cinthia.</p>

<p>The young man laughed easily, soon getting over his
surprise, and answered:</p>

<p>“It means, mother, that Mr. Dawn refused to give
me Cinthia, so we took the bit between our teeth and ran
away. But how came you here? You did not pursue
us, did you, dear?”</p>

<p>“No, no; for I did not dream of this. I made up my
mind last night to come to Washington on a little—business
trip while you were away. When—when—did you
arrive?”</p>

<p>“Just a few minutes ago. And I thought we had better
get married before we registered, or even had breakfast,
for fear Mr. Dawn might be on our track.”</p>

<p>“We must have traveled on the same train. How
strange we did not meet—how fortunate that we meet
now!” she cried, with almost tragic emphasis.</p>

<p>“Yes, mother, for now you can witness our marriage
and give us your blessing. Cinthia, dear, shake hands
with my mother.”</p>

<p>Cinthia put out a little trembling hand, and looked<span class="pagenum">[82]</span>
timidly out of the corner of her drooping eyes at the
beautiful lady.</p>

<p>She met a cold glance, and the hand that just touched
hers without the slightest pressure was icy.</p>

<p>“Are you ready now?” asked the minister, again opening
his book.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Arthur, taking Cinthia’s hand, and
turning to him eagerly.</p>

<p>But there came a low, heart-wrung cry from the mother’s
lips:</p>

<p>“<em>Wait!</em>”</p>

<p>All turned toward her in surprise.</p>

<p>Her eyes were like coals of fire, her face wore a bluish
pallor, her very lips were white as she uttered, hoarsely:</p>

<p>“I beg pardon, but the ceremony must not go on—until—until—I
speak—to—Arthur!”</p>

<p>Every word came jerkily between the pallid lips, and
her outstretched hand clutched Arthur’s arm.</p>

<p>“Come with me—let me speak to you alone!” she
implored.</p>

<p>Every one realized that she was laboring under the
most terrible agitation. It seemed plain to all that she
meant to forbid the marriage.</p>

<p>Arthur frowned at her—the son whose wishes she
had never thwarted—and exclaimed, impatiently:</p>

<p>“Can you not wait till the ceremony is over? Remember,
Mr. Dawn may come at any moment.”</p>

<p>“No—I can not wait! Come,” eagerly, “I will not<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
detain you long. Miss Dawn, will you not wait here just
a few moments while—I—I—tell Arthur—the truth?”</p>

<p>“Go, Arthur,” answered the girl, faintly; and she
sunk upon a chair, trembling in every limb, sure in her
heart that something was going to happen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Varian was angry with her—she was sure. How
coldly she had looked at her, how reluctantly she had
touched her hand with icy fingers!</p>

<p>Mrs. Varian dragged Arthur away with her to her
own room, and then the genial host said kindly, in sympathy
for the suffering girl:</p>

<p>“I will send a maid to show you to a room to rest,
Miss Dawn, while you are waiting for your friends.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I thank you,” she answered, gratefully, desperately
glad to be alone.</p>

<p>When she was gone, the minister said, uneasily:</p>

<p>“I do not believe there is any use in my waiting. There
will be no marriage if that proud Mrs. Varian can have
her own way.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” returned the host. “I could see
plainly that she intended to break off the marriage. I
believe that she pursued them here, instead of just meeting
them by accident, as she pretended. I never heard of
such a coincidence. I suppose the girl is poor, as her
clothing was plain and cheap, and the mother and son
are rich. In fact, I know they are, because the young
fellow has stayed here several times before and he
throws money about like a young prince.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[84]</span></p>

<p>“He said that her father had refused him her hand,
so he must be a very black sheep, as poor men are usually
glad to welcome a rich son-in-law,” said the minister;
adding: “I believe I had better go, if you think I shall
not be needed. I am sorry for that sweet young girl,
for I am sure that proud lady will show her no mercy.”</p>

<p>“If you are needed, I will send to the parsonage for
you, but it would be a surprise to me if the marriage
comes off now,” the host said, candidly.</p>

<p>So presently the minister went away, rather disappointed
at losing the expected liberal wedding fee.</p>

<p>Cinthia locked herself into the luxurious room, and
laid aside her hat and jacket, so that she might bathe her
face and neck, and brush out the golden waves of her
beautiful hair.</p>

<p>When she had finished, she gazed at herself in the
long mirror, and saw an exquisitely beautiful young
creature, although her face was pale, and there were dark
circles under her heavy eyes, caused by the excitement
and emotion of the last thirty-six hours.</p>

<p>She sunk into a large easy-chair, and waited, with a
wildly throbbing heart, for the end of the interview between
Arthur and his mother.</p>

<p>She had a lurking presentiment of evil. It had fallen
on her at the touch of Mrs. Varian’s cold hand, and the
strange glance of her eyes—so different from her sweet
friendliness the night she had been her guest at Idlewild.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[85]</span></p>

<p>Yet Arthur had said his mother was pleased at their
engagement. What could it all mean?</p>

<p>The lids drooped over her tired young eyes, and in
spite of her anxiety, weariness overcame her, and she
fell into a heavy sleep—so she did not have to undergo
the suspense of waiting, for more than half an hour
passed away before there came a low, half-deprecating
rap upon the door.</p>

<p>It startled Cinthia, and she sprung awake, looking
about her in confusion, before she comprehended her
position.</p>

<p>The rap came again, and a little impatiently, so she
hastily opened the door to Mrs. Varian, saying:</p>

<p>“Pardon me if I have kept you waiting. I was fatigued
with travel, and fell asleep.”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“AN ETERNAL FAREWELL!”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“I am glad you could sleep,” Mrs. Varian answered,
as she stepped across the threshold and confronted the
lovely girl whose heart she was about to wound so
cruelly.</p>

<p>But, somehow, she did not shrink from the task for
a change had come over her feelings toward Cinthia, and
she experienced a sort of fierce pleasure in the task now<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
before her. In a way, it would be taking revenge on a
woman who had wronged Mrs. Varian, and who was dead
now—dead, but unforgiven in her lonely grave.</p>

<p>For this girl, her daughter, how could Mrs. Varian
cherish any love?</p>

<p>Perhaps something like pity touched her heart as the
large, soft dark eyes turned upon her so wistfully, but
she fought down the sympathy, saying to herself:</p>

<p>“Her mother had no mercy on me—none! And the
same blood runs in Cinthia’s veins. She could not be
trusted to bring her husband anything but ill.”</p>

<p>She threw back her magnificent head with a haughty
motion, and said, curtly:</p>

<p>“Sit down, Cinthia, for what I am about to tell you
may possibly ruffle your nerves.”</p>

<p>Cinthia obeyed with surprising meekness for one so
proud; but the imperious woman before her had the
habit of command, and every one seemed to obey.</p>

<p>She, too, took a chair, as if perhaps her own nerves
were not quite steady. Then she said:</p>

<p>“Cinthia, you have done wrong in disobeying your
father’s commands, when he told you there were reasons
why you should not marry my son.”</p>

<p>Cinthia bowed without answering. She had no defense
to make, only the mute protest of her wistful eyes.</p>

<p>“I am here to tell you,” continued Mrs. Varian, “that
on my side there exist as grave reasons as your father’s
for protesting against your marrying Arthur.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[87]</span></p>

<p>The blood rose in the girl’s face, mounted to her fair
brow, and receded, leaving her pale as death, her eyes
beginning to flash with pride. She essayed to speak, and
faltered:</p>

<p>“Arthur told me—that you—were pleased—with our
engagement. I—I—did not think it mattered much—disobeying
a cold, unloving father who has neglected me all
my life. If he had been fond of me, kind to me, I would
have acted differently.”</p>

<p>A strange gleam shot into the brilliant eyes of Mrs.
Varian, almost as if it pleased her to know that Everard
Dawn had been cold and cruel to his only daughter. Then
she looked down and played with the diamonds that
flashed on her white hands, as she continued, gravely:</p>

<p>“Arthur and I have talked matters over together—there
are things we would rather not confide to you, best
for you not to hear—and we have decided that your
father is right. You can never be Arthur’s wife.”</p>

<p>Perhaps Cinthia had expected something like this, but
it struck her with the force of a great shock. She began
to tremble like a leaf in a gale, crying out:</p>

<p>“You do not mean that he—Arthur—rejects me—after
bringing me away from my father’s home to marry me—<a id="Ref_87" href="#BRef_87">jilts</a>
me at the very altar!”</p>

<p>It was piteous, that heartcry wrung from the profoundest
depths of feeling, and for a moment Mrs. Varian
was silent, sympathetic. Then she looked down again at
her rings, and answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[88]</span></p>

<p>“I beg that you will not blame Arthur; he is the soul
of honor; but in this matter he has no choice save to
give back your promise.”</p>

<p>“He sent you to tell me this? Why was he not brave
enough to come himself?”</p>

<p>“He believed it was better not to see you again,” the
lady answered; and Cinthia gasped in a sort of terror.</p>

<p>Not to see him again—her Arthur, her love, her king,
who was just now to have been her happy bridegroom!
Why, this was too terrible to believe! Parted in an hour,
torn asunder at the altar by the cruelty of those cold
hearts that age and time had taught forgetfulness of love.
Why, this was too hard to bear!</p>

<p>It seemed to her that she was swooning, dying; the
same sick feeling came to her that she had felt last night,
when her father’s voice shouted to them in the blackness
of the night; but a sudden hope, a lightning suspicion, restored
her fainting senses, and she sat erect again.</p>

<p>“I—I—” she began incoherently. “Oh, Mrs. Varian,
it would break my heart to believe the cruel thing you
have just said! My Arthur—<em>mine</em>—who was to be my
husband—to turn against me all in one moment, to wish
never to see me again! You are deceiving me. I will
not believe such an impossible story save from his own
lips.”</p>

<p>With that passionate defiance she lay back pale and
panting, gazing with half-shut eyes at her tormentor.</p>

<p>“Is it so?” said Mrs. Varian. “Then you shall be<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
satisfied. It was only to spare you and Arthur pain.
But perhaps it will please you to hear that he suffers as
much as you do over this pang of parting.”</p>

<p>There came to her the first intimation of an unsuspected
nobility in the girl’s nature when Cinthia uttered, drearily:</p>

<p>“It would be cruel—nay, wicked—in me to wish any
one to feel the agony of soul that is my portion.”</p>

<p>“Yet Arthur shares it with you, child, to the deepest,
bitterest dregs. Come with me, and see.”</p>

<p>She took Cinthia’s cold, unresisting hand, and led her
along the corridor; continuing in an explanatory manner:</p>

<p>“He should have come to you, but the shock of his
broken love dream almost stretched him dead at my feet.
I had to call in a physician, but he is better now.”</p>

<p>She pushed open a door, and led Cinthia in. She saw
Arthur lying on a lounge, with a ghastly face and closed
eyes.</p>

<p>“Are you asleep, my son? because, after all, it will be
better for you to tell Cinthia yourself. She can not believe
me.”</p>

<p>He started and opened his dark-blue eyes. When they
fell on the placid sorrowful face of his lost little love,
the burning tears sparkled into them and rolled down
upon his cheeks. Years of anguish could not have
changed him more than this keen stroke of an hour ago.</p>

<p>“Cinthia”—he breathed hollowly, and she came and
bent over him, impulsively slipping her little hand into his<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>
as he went on—“Cinthia, do not think me false or fickle,
or turned against you by the arbitrary wishes of our
parents. I never loved you better than in this hour when
I must part from you forever. Cinthia, it is the most
fortunate thing in the world that my mother chanced on
us in time to prevent our mad marriage. A great gulf
is fixed between us that neither our love nor our hopes
can ever cross. My mother has telegraphed for your
father to come and take you home, and we must bid each
other an eternal farewell.”</p>

<p>Cinthia felt herself sinking, falling; but an arm slipped
round her waist, and Mrs. Varian, with a sigh, pillowed
the unconscious head against her breast.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“OH, WHAT A TIME!”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Mrs. Flint was at her wits’ end to know what to do
for the strange woman whom her brother had mistakenly
brought home as his daughter.</p>

<p>The upshot was that she simply did nothing at all but
to sit still and stare, and wonder where the woman came
from, how Everard came to bring her home, and what
had become of Cinthia.</p>

<p>Presently she heard steps and voices, and rushed to
the door, glad that her vigil with the seemingly dead
woman was ended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[91]</span></p>

<p>Everard Dawn, alarmed at the duration of Cinthia’s
swoon, had brought a physician with him, and exclaimed
as soon as he saw his sister:</p>

<p>“Has Cinthia recovered yet?”</p>

<p>“You can see for yourself,” she answered, in a dazed
way, as she ushered them into the room.</p>

<p>The two men, almost blinded by the brightness of the
room, after the outer storm and darkness, advanced to
the sofa and bent over the patient in keen anxiety, while
Mrs. Flint blurted out, nervously:</p>

<p>“Everard; what is the matter? Why did you bring
that strange woman here instead of Cinthia?”</p>

<p>At the same moment the old doctor added:</p>

<p>“It is not little Cinthia but a stranger.”</p>

<p>Everard Dawn bent down with an air of incredulity
that quickly changed as he saw what a terrible mistake
he had made.</p>

<p>The cry that rose from his tortured heart, the baffled
purpose, the agony, the pain, rang forever in the ears of
the two who heard it. Then exhausted nature gave way.
He fell writhing to the floor in convulsions.</p>

<p>Then <a id="Ref_91" href="#BRef_91">Mrs. Flint</a> and the doctor had their hands full
with the two patients.</p>

<p>They ignored the strange woman until Mr. Dawn had
been quieted and removed to his bed, where the doctor
kept him quiescent by the use of opiates while he turned
his attention to his other charge.</p>

<p>“Who is she? Where did she come from? I’ve never<span class="pagenum">[92]</span>
seen her face around here,” he said curiously to Mrs.
Flint, who replied by confiding in him all that she knew,
which, of course, threw no light upon the mystery; so
without more ado they set to work to restore the poor
creature to life.</p>

<p>It was a serious undertaking, and lasted until the gray
dawn of another dreary day glimmered in through the
windows of the sitting-room.</p>

<p>Then the woman lay asleep, having recovered sufficiently
to open her eyes, stare at them uncomprehendingly,
and to swallow some broth with the avidity produced
by starvation.</p>

<p>“Poor soul! it is the want of food that has brought her
to this pass. See how flabby her flesh is, and how loosely
it hangs on her large frame! Look at her shabby, worn
clothing, not much better than a tramp’s; and her broken
shoes, how pitiful. It is doubtful if she survives even
after the long spell of sickness that threatens her,” said
the doctor.</p>

<p>“Good land, doctor, a long spell, you say? Why, what
are you going to do about it? Can’t she be sent to the
almshouse?”</p>

<p>“‘I was a stranger, and ye took me in!’” quoted the
old physician, reverently.</p>

<p>The old lady thus referred to her bible, muttered repentantly:</p>

<p>“Lord, forgive my hardness of heart! I’ll do the best
I can, Doctor Savoy; but I’m an old woman, and the<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
nursing will go hard with me, you see, along with my
other troubles.”</p>

<p>“You shall have help—there are plenty good women
willing to help you,” he replied, and rose to go, adding:
“I will go and bring one right away.”</p>

<p>“Get me a trained nurse, doctor—I’ll pay the cost—for
what with Everard and <em>her</em> sick on my hands, I’ll need
skilled help.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Dawn will be up and about in twenty-four
hours, I believe, and out and gone after his eloping
daughter. You need not give him any more of that opiate,
and he will be awake for his breakfast. Tell him to remain
quiet in his room till I call again this afternoon.”</p>

<p>So saying, the good old physician bustled out and away,
and he did not leave Mrs. Flint long alone with her
burden of perplexities and worry, but directly sent to her
the best nurse the neighborhood afforded, a stout
middle-aged woman, with a keen eye and cheery smile,
who at once took on her younger shoulders the burden of
Mrs. Flint’s care.</p>

<p>Together they arranged a tiny hall bedroom—all there
was to spare—and removed the sleeping woman to the
comfortable bed.</p>

<p>“Now, Mrs. Flint, you go and lie down; you look dead
beat, that’s a fact,” the nurse said, compassionately.</p>

<p>“I must start my kitchen fire and have a bite of breakfast
first. Afterward I’ll rest.”</p>

<p>When the breakfast was over, she stole into her<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
brother’s room, but he was still sleeping heavily from the
drug Doctor Savoy had administered.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flint went to her room and snatched two hours
of rest, from which she was aroused by an impatient
rapping on the door.</p>

<p>“Mercy sake, who can that be?” she ejaculated, making
haste to answer the summons.</p>

<p>She opened the door, and found a telegraph-messenger
with a message for her brother. He ran away shivering
in the cold air as soon as she had signed the receipt.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flint turned it over in her shaking fingers, soliloquizing:</p>

<p>“From Washington—to tell us of course that they’re
married! Oh, dear, what a time!” and she hurried to
her brother’s room.</p>

<p>To her surprise, she found him up and dressed, putting
the finishing touches to his toilet. The tears rushed to
her eyes at the sight of his haggard, miserable face.</p>

<p>“Rebecca, I was fooled last night. Arthur Varian gave
me that tramp he had picked up in the road for my own
child, and I let him deceive me. But I shall go on their
tracks at once,” he said weakly.</p>

<p>For answer she held out the telegram.</p>

<p>He snatched it with a cry of anguish, and quickly mastered
the contents.</p>

<p>His face changed marvelously, and he exclaimed
hoarsely:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[95]</span></p>

<p>“Thank God!” and tossed her the telegram. She
read:</p>


<p class="center">“Cinthia is here safe with me, and not married. Please
come at once and take her home.</p>

<p class="center pminus1" style="padding-left:15em">“<span class="smcap">Mrs. Varian.</span>”</p>

<p>The address was carefully given, and the man’s face,
from anger and distress, changed to keenest joy.</p>

<p>“This is better than I could have hoped,” he cried.
“Can you give me some breakfast at once, Rebecca, for
I must leave for Washington on the earliest train.”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A DEADLY FEUD.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When Cinthia recovered her senses she found herself
lying on her bed and the air was heavy with the scent of
eau-de-Cologne, with which Mrs. Varian was gently bathing
her face and hands.</p>

<p>“Do you feel better now?” the lady gently inquired,
and Cinthia mechanically answered:</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>In fact her head was aching wretchedly, and her heart
was heavy as lead, but she would seek no sympathy from
Arthur Varian’s mother, who had turned against her so
cruelly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[96]</span></p>

<p>“I am glad to hear it. Perhaps you will feel like taking
breakfast now,” touching the bell.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no, no!” cried Cinthia; feeling as if she could
never swallow a morsel of food again.</p>

<p>“But yes,” returned Mrs. Varian, smiling, as she rose
as if to go.</p>

<p>Cinthia raised her heavy head and held out a deprecatory
hand.</p>

<p>“You are going,” she said, “and it is not likely that
we shall ever meet again. Wait till I ask you one question.
Why is it that you hate me?”</p>

<p>“I do not hate you, child.”</p>

<p>“Why deny it, when I have read it in your eyes?”
cried the girl, accusingly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Varian’s face worked with emotion, and she
started forward as if she would have embraced the girl,
then suddenly drew back, saying huskily:</p>

<p>“Cinthia, you are mistaken. I—I—do not hate—<em>you!
It was—your mother!</em>”</p>

<p>“My mother!” the girl gasped, in bewilderment, gazing
in wonder at the beautiful and agitated face of the lady.</p>

<p>Mrs. Varian continued, hoarsely:</p>

<p>“My feelings toward you are complex, Cinthia. For
your own sake, I could love you—you are beautiful and
winning, but between your parents and me there has been
a deadly feud—they both wronged me! I have hated
them both for years and years, and that hatred comes between
you and me, child, like an impassable gulf. That<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>
first night I saw you I did not guess at your parentage,
hence my attraction to you. When I learned the truth
upon the return of your father, my feelings changed. I
do not deny it. I could not contemplate with any calmness
the thought of a marriage between you and Arthur.</p>

<p>“Now ask me no more. I have said more than I intended
to do, and can reveal nothing further of that past
which lies like a dead weight on my happiness. I must
leave you to return to my son, but I will come back when
you have had your breakfast served to you, and—”</p>

<p>Cinthia was sitting up on the side of the bed, her hair
a disheveled tangle of gold about her pallid face, with
its great star-like eyes. They flashed with sudden pride
now as she interrupted:</p>

<p>“Let me beg you to remain away, nor seek to cross
again the gulf that you say yawns between us. I am
better alone with my humiliation,” bitterly.</p>

<p>“Do not call it that, Cinthia—you do not understand!
And I must take charge of you until your father comes,”
insisted Mrs. Varian.</p>

<p>“I prefer to remain alone.”</p>

<p>“It would appear cruel in me to leave you like this,
seemingly forlorn and friendless.”</p>

<p>Cinthia laughed mirthlessly, and reiterated:</p>

<p>“I prefer to wait alone for my father.”</p>

<p>“Very well, I must bow to your will. God bless you,
my poor girl,” and the haughty woman moved with a
stately step from the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[98]</span></p>

<p>Cinthia threw herself back upon the bed with closed
eyes and pallid lips. The agony of that moment no pen
could describe.</p>

<p>Was it only two days ago she had been wishing for
something to occur and break up the monotony of her life,
and resenting Mrs. Flint’s homilies upon her discontent?</p>

<p>Something had happened with a vengeance.</p>

<p>The love that had nestled in her heart that day, a shy,
sweet new-comer, had been fanned into strong, passionate
life by hurrying events that now closed round her like a
grasp of steel threatening to crush out all the sweetness
of life forever.</p>

<p>She had tasted the sweetness of loving and being loved,
she who had been lonely and heart-hungry so long; but
now the sweet cup of joy was dashed from her lips and
bitter dregs offered in its stead.</p>

<p>They had parted her from her heart’s love, Arthur.
With his own lips, that so lately had sworn eternal fealty
to her, he had uttered the edict of their eternal separation,
for no cause save that their parents cherished an
old feud.</p>

<p>It was cruel, bitter, and Cinthia’s heart hardened with
rebellion against her fate.</p>

<p>She longed desperately for death to end the agony of
love and humiliation under which she suffered.</p>

<p>“Oh, if I could just slip away out of life now—this
moment!” she cried, in fierce intolerance of her pain; and
a lightning temptation came to her to end it all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[99]</span></p>

<p>She began to pace restlessly up and down the room,
wondering what would be the easiest way to take her own
life—her life that was so unbearable now!</p>

<p>It would be so easy to close all the apertures for air,
turn on the gas, and lie down on her bed until asphyxiation
came to her relief and wrenched life out of its suffering
frame.</p>

<p>“I wonder if it would be painful. I don’t want to
suffer,” she said to herself, with keen physical shrinking,
while her active mind pictured the scene when they should
come to seek her and find her cold and dead—her cruel
father, fickle Arthur, and his revengeful mother, who,
for the sake of an old-time wrong, was willing to break
two fond young hearts.</p>

<p>What keen remorse would pierce their hearts when
they saw that they had driven her to desperation and
death! Perhaps they would repent when it was all too
late. At the moving thought, Cinthia dissolved into floods
of tears.</p>

<p>She knelt down by a chair, with her head on her arm,
and heavy sobs shook her slight frame like a reed in the
wind.</p>

<p>She cried out that she wished she had never seen Arthur
Varian, who had taught her the sweet meaning of love
only to make her more lonely and wretched than she had
been before.</p>

<p>But a rap on the door made her start up in alarm and
hastily dash away her tears before she opened it to a<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
white-clad waiter bearing a tray containing a dainty
breakfast, which he arranged on a little table, then withdrew.</p>

<p>Then Cinthia, in spite of her grief, discovered that she
was unromantically hungry.</p>

<p>On yesterday, while sulking in her chamber at home
she had refused food all day, and on the train last night
had only taken some fruit.</p>

<p>The appetizing aroma of hot rolls, broiled birds, and
steaming chocolate began to appeal to her irresistibly, and
she ended by drawing up a chair and making a tolerable
meal for a girl who thought her heart was broken and
was actually contemplating suicide.</p>

<p>She did not feel half so morbid when she finished her
chocolate. Life was bitter still, but death did not seem so
desirable.</p>

<p>Her first temptation to suicide changed to a thought of
flight.</p>

<p>“What if I should slip away and hide myself in the
great world, where they could never find me again? I
might make a career for myself, become a great actress,
maybe, and when they saw me successful on the stage,
they would think I had forgotten cruel Arthur, as I
wish them to do, for I would not have him think I love
him still,” she thought, bitterly, her mind running on
novels she had read in which romantic girls, thrown alone
on the world, had encountered wonderful adventures, and
finally carved their names on the rock of <a id="Ref_100" href="#BRef_100">love.</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[101]</span></p>

<p>Cinthia was utterly wretched and despairing, and in
the mood for anything reckless.</p>

<p>She flung on her hat and jacket, and turned toward
the door.</p>

<p>She was actually going to venture out into the world
alone, a desperate victim whom fate had used most cruelly,
and who longed to escape from everything she had known
into some new, untried sphere.</p>

<p>She had no idea where she was going. She would escape
into the street, and wander aimlessly up and down
with the busy throngs; that was just now her only
thought.</p>

<p>She stretched out her hand to the door-knob, and at
the instant a light rap on the outside startled her.</p>

<p>“It is Mrs. Varian; but she cannot forbid my going,”
she thought, defiantly, and flung wide the door.</p>

<p>A stranger stood on the threshold—a lovely woman
richly dressed, faint, delicate perfume exhaling from
her silks and furs.</p>

<p>“Ah, you are going out? I beg pardon; but will you
permit me to enter your room for a moment? I have
lately occupied it—in fact, only went away this morning—and
I have discovered that I forgot two of my rings,” she
exclaimed in a sweet, silvery voice like liquid music.</p>

<p>Cinthia stood aside to let her enter; and, floating to the
dressing-case, she lifted the scarf and displayed two sparkling
rings.</p>

<p>“See! It is fortunate that the chamber-maid is honest,<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
or that she did not discover these. I thank you for your
courtesy. But, excuse me, you were going out. My dear
young lady are you feeling well? I assure you that you
look extremely ill; and there is a sharp east wind blowing
outside. You are trembling; your face is as pale as chalk;
your beautiful hair is all in disorder. You ought to be in
bed with your mother watching over you.”</p>

<p>“My mother, alas!” cried Cinthia; and again her slight
form shook with a tempest of sobs and tears that startled
the handsome stranger, who forced her gently into a chair.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Everard Dawn was speeding to Washington
on the fastest train. He arrived there at dusk, and
took a cab to the hotel where Mrs. Varian was staying, immediately
sending up his card to that lady, and receiving
a summons to her private parlor.</p>

<p>She was waiting there alone, and their greeting was
cold and formal, though she could not help noting the
signs of last night’s agitation on his pale face.</p>

<p>Waving him to a seat, she recounted briefly all that
had transpired since their meeting yesterday.</p>

<p>“I came away last night—frankly, I could not breathe
the same air with you—and I found them here. It was
one of the greatest shocks of my life,” she said, and he
bowed coldly.</p>

<p>She continued, stiffly:</p>

<p>“She is here waiting for you, but in a most rebellious
mood: in fact, forbade me to re-enter her room to-day, so
she must have spent a lonely time, poor girl! But before<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
you go to her, Arthur wishes an interview with you on
a very particular subject relating to Cinthia. You will
find him alone in there,” indicating a door.</p>

<p>Everard Dawn looked fixedly at her a moment then
bowed and left her standing there, while he went in to
Arthur Varian.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“REMEMBER THAT I LOVED YOU WELL.”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The beautiful stranger pushed Cinthia gently into a
chair, and sat down by her side.</p>

<p>“I hope you will not think me intruding, my dear girl;
but you inspire me with a strange interest. Are you here
alone?” she cried, earnestly.</p>

<p>“Alone!” answered Cinthia in a tragic tone, as she
lifted her anguished dark eyes and scanned the other’s
face.</p>

<p>She beheld one of the sweetest, fairest faces she had
ever beheld.</p>

<p>The lady might have been thirty-five or more, but she
possessed that charm of beauty that always suggests
youth—perfect features, a complexion fresh as the morning;
large, tender eyes of the brightest blue, and abundant
tresses of shining golden brown hair, while a mouth like
Cupid’s bow in form, and crimson as a rose, revealed in a<span class="pagenum">[104]</span>
dazzling smile small pearly white teeth, that added the
last charm to her winsome loveliness.</p>

<p>Cinthia gazed fixedly at that winning face, drew a long
breath of emotion, and instantly became captive to
beauty’s bow and spear.</p>

<p>She was irresistibly drawn to the graceful woman
whose sweet, silvery voice sounded like music in her ears
as she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“You are in trouble, dear; I feel it, see it in your pale
face and sad eyes. I hear it in the anguish of your voice.
And you are alone, you say! Then I dare not go away
and leave you like this, lest harm befall you. Let me help
you!”</p>

<p>“No one can help me,” Cinthia answered in stubborn
despair; but all the while that voice and smile were thrilling
her heart with subtle tenderness.</p>

<p>“Then the case must indeed be serious,” cried the
lady, gently slipping her arm around Cinthia’s waist,
moved by an impulse she scarcely understood herself;
while she continued, gently:</p>

<p>“My heart aches for your sorrow, dear, and although
we are strangers to each other, I long to comfort you.
Confide in me, and perhaps I can help you. Is it a question
of lack of means? Or, sadder still, of—love?”</p>

<p>“Of love!” burst out Cinthia; and she dropped her
head on that silken shoulder in a passionate outburst of
tears, won in spite of herself by the divine art of
sympathy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[105]</span></p>

<p>And then, since both were strangely, magnetically attracted
to each other, it was not hard for her to draw
from Cinthia the brief, sad story of her life and love
down to the very moment when she had opened the door
to fly out into the street with the half-formed plan of
suicide yet in her mind.</p>

<p>Oh, what a pathetic, moving story it was! And how
it touched the listener’s tender heart, moving her to
tears!</p>

<p>She could sympathize with all that Cinthia told her, and
could share in her resentment against her unloving father,
her strict aunt, and the lover whose affection had not been
proof against the schemes of his proud mother. To her
eyes, as to Cinthia’s, it all looked as if Mrs. Varian and
Everard Dawn had made of the hapless lovers a sacrifice
to a family feud vaguely hinted at in the lady’s confession
to Cinthia, that her mother had been her bitterest enemy
and was unforgiven in her grave.</p>

<p>With all her heart she espoused Cinthia’s side, and
freely expressed contempt for Arthur’s part in the girl’s
sorrow.</p>

<p>“He has acted the part of a coward, forsaking you
thus at the command of his haughty mother, and I would
think no more of him, dear, for he is not worth it,” she
exclaimed, warmly.</p>

<p>Cinthia only sighed. She did not believe now that she
could ever put Arthur out of her thoughts.</p>

<p>In spite of his seeming injustice to her, and the humiliation<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
he had put upon her, something in her heart vaguely
pleaded in his defense—perhaps his illness and pallor, and
the keen anguish of his voice when he had said to her
so sadly that they must bid each other an eternal farewell.</p>

<p>There had been something solemn, even tragic, in that
parting, almost like the farewell of death. Resentment
did not have any part in its supreme despair. It was
rather</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The lovely stranger continued earnestly;</p>

<p>“You are young yet, and in time a new love may replace
this lost one, and bring you great happiness.”</p>

<p>“Happiness is not for me. I am ill-fated!” moaned
Cinthia.</p>

<p>“Do not feel so despondent. The young are naturally
morbid. I know that by experience. I have had a great
sorrow in my own life, and overlived it.”</p>

<p>Cinthia looked at her almost incredulously, she seemed
so fair and bright, and her inexperienced eyes could not
read the signs of a past grief in the delicate lines about
the lips and eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[107]</span></p>

<p>“I have overlived it, and so will you,” repeated the
lady.</p>

<p>“Tell me how to do it. Help me!” cried Cinthia, appealingly;
and as the lady remained gravely silent a
moment, she added:</p>

<p>“Oh, if I could be filled with some great excitement
that would occupy my thoughts, I believe I could put him
out of my mind, except in very quiet moments. I was
thinking just before you came in that I would like to go
on the stage to become a great actress.”</p>

<p>An expression of dismay lowered over the fair face
regarding her so intently, as Cinthia continued, eagerly:</p>

<p>“As we came to the hotel this morning, I saw through
the carriage windows large posters announcing the appearance
of a great actress to-night and this afternoon in a
popular play. I have been thinking of her, and that I
would like to have such a life. Do you think if I tried
that I—might succeed?”</p>

<p>“Ah, child, you do not know what labor and trouble
would be involved in such an undertaking.”</p>

<p>“I should not care for that—it would be what I need
to turn my thoughts away from Arthur. And, indeed,
the desire has taken hold on me, fascinates me. I intend
to try.”</p>

<p>“No, dear, you must not do it. It is not wise, nor
desirable. I am glad that I happened in on you this morning,
for there is no one more capable of advising you in
this crisis of your life. I tell you stage-work is heartache<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
and sorrow even when crowned with a little success
such as Madame Ray’s, whose name you read on the
posters this morning. I tell you this, and I ought to know,
for I am that woman!”</p>

<p>“You?” Cinthia cried, wide-eyed and wondering, and
with a sad smile. The other answered:</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Taking Cinthia’s hand, and caressing it softly in both
her own, she added:</p>

<p>“When I was young, like you, I had a great sorrow
that sent my thoughts wandering, like yours, in search
of a sensation in which to drown memory and grief. I
turned to the stage, and after a period of drudgery and
patience most painful to remember, earned a measure of
success; so I am in a position to know what I am talking
about, and to advise you against the course that I myself
adopted. Not for worlds, my dear, would I have you
go on the stage. No, no; it is a feverish life in the glare
of the foot-lights. When I am rich enough to live without
my work, I shall immediately retire to a private life.”</p>

<p>But she saw that her words had not convinced Cinthia.
The feverish fascination was still in her mind, the longing
to escape from the painful present into something new
and strange.</p>

<p>But she persevered:</p>

<p>“If you will listen to me, dear child, you will yield to
your father’s wish to place you in school for two years.
Believe me, the course of study will be far less hard<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
than the training for the stage. Suppose you come with
me now to our rehearsal, and remain for our <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matinée</i> performance?
It will give you a glimpse of theatrical life
behind the scenes that may perhaps turn your mind from
this fascination.”</p>

<p>“I will be glad to go with you,” answered Cinthia,
eager for escape from the wretched present, and with
strange reluctance to part from the charming actress.</p>

<p>“We will go at once, then,” said Madame Ray, rising,
and adding: “Perhaps you should ask Mrs. Varian’s
leave?”</p>

<p>“I shall do nothing of the kind,” Cinthia answered, rebelliously.
“I have told her I wished to be alone, and
she will not even know I am gone.”</p>

<p>“But your father might arrive.”</p>

<p>“He can not do so until very late, and I will probably
be back when he comes,” Cinthia answered, but wishing
in her heart that she were going this moment so far out
of her old life that she need never encounter her father
again—the stern, unloving father for whom she did not
pretend an affection.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A TRAGIC PAST.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The actress did not urge her any further. Taking her
hand as fondly as if she had been her own daughter, she
led her from the room, down to her waiting carriage. At<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
dusk that evening she had not returned, and when Everard
Dawn went to seek her, in company with Mrs. Varian,
they found the room untenanted.</p>

<p>Mr. Dawn had come out of Arthur’s room with a
pale, agitated face, and a look about the eyes that in a
woman would have betokened recent tears. It had, in
fact, been a most emotional interview, and one from
which he was glad to escape.</p>

<p>But the softness of his expression gave place to pride
and coldness when he saw Mrs. Varian waiting for him,
and he said, with a haughtiness that equaled her own:</p>

<p>“Will you have the kindness to conduct me to
Cinthia?”</p>

<p>She wondered why he did not say “my daughter,”
instead of Cinthia; but it pleased her, nevertheless, the
indifference he showed toward his child. She was selfish
enough to feel glad that he had no love for the daughter
of the woman who had been her enemy in life, and whose
sin against her had been too heinous for any possibility
of forgiveness.</p>

<p>With a slight bow of assent she moved on by his side
to Cinthia’s room, where she knocked several times without
receiving any answer.</p>

<p>With a sudden misgiving at the memory of the girl’s
desperate mood that morning, she opened the door and
looked inside.</p>

<p>“Good heavens, she is gone!” turning to him with
startled eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[111]</span></p>

<p>He answered sternly, rebukingly:</p>

<p>“She should not have been left alone. But, of course,
I could not expect you to watch over her mother’s
daughter.”</p>

<p>Her great eyes flashed in her pale face as she retorted:</p>

<p>“I certainly had no cause to love her, but I would not
wish her any ill. We had better inquire about her down
at the office.”</p>

<p>They did so, and were startled and mystified by the
news that Madame Ray, the actress, had called on Miss
Dawn that morning, and soon afterward took her away
with her in the carriage.</p>

<p>“The lady is playing at the Metropolitan Theater. Perhaps
the young lady has gone to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matinée</i>,” said the
polite clerk, wondering at their blank faces.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, of course,” Mr. Dawn returned, unwilling
to make his perturbation known. He turned away with
Mrs. Varian, saying to her in an undertone: “I will go
in search of her, and—you had better keep this news
from Arthur.”</p>

<p>“I will,” she answered; and he left her with a slight,
cold bow.</p>

<p>She stood still in the corridor and watched him out of
sight with a stony gaze ere she retreated to her own room
and sunk half fainting upon a chair, murmuring:</p>

<p>“Ah! cruel fate that made him cross my path again!
Was I not wretched enough already?”</p>

<p>Whatever there had been in the past between those two<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>
it had surely been most tragic, judging by their present
scorn of each other, and their impatience of the fate that
had brought them together again.</p>

<p>For more than an hour she crouched in her chair with
drooping head and a gray, ashen face, from which her
great burning eyes shone like live coals; then she rose and
stared at herself in the long mirror, muttering, bleakly:</p>

<p>“What a wreck I look after one of those spells, wan
and gray, like a woman aged in an hour. It would frighten
Arthur to see me like this, and he would surely guess at
the hidden fires that slumber, volcano-like, in my breast,
eating away love and hope and joy. He must not see
me thus;” and with the aid of cosmetics, skillfully applied,
she soon hid the traces of the passion-storm that
had swept with devastating force over her soul. Then
swallowing a light draught of wine, she sought her son.</p>

<p>He lay quiescent upon the couch, as he had lain all day,
after his illness of the morning, with his white hand before
his eyes. There had been a most exciting interview
between him and Mr. Dawn, and he was now temporarily
utterly worn out and exhausted.</p>

<p>The unhappy mother sat down by her son and ran
her slender fingers caressingly through the soft clustering
locks of his abundant hair.</p>

<p>She saw his pale face writhe with a spasm of inward
feeling, as he muttered through trembling lips:</p>

<p>“Are they gone?”</p>

<p>She answered, evasively:</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">LOVE AND LOSS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Meanwhile, Everard Dawn flung himself into a cab and
hurried to the theater, his mind divided between thoughts
of his daughter and the magnificent woman he had left
behind him.</p>

<p>Arrived at the theater, he purchased a ticket, and entered
just as the last act was being performed; but without
glancing at the stage, he threw a hurried, anxious
glance around the glittering horseshoe in search of
Cinthia’s face.</p>

<p>To his surprise and unutterable relief, he presently
beheld her fair face and shining hair half hidden behind
the sweeping curtain in a private box, from which she
watched the stage with kindling eyes of delight.</p>

<p>Quickly he made his way to her side, and she glanced
around at him with suddenly gloomy eyes of fear and
dislike.</p>

<p>Bending over her, he whispered, agitatedly:</p>

<p>“Cinthia, do not look at me so coldly and angrily. I
am your father.”</p>

<p>“You do well to remind me of your claim,” she answered,
bitterly, turning her glance back to the stage.</p>

<p>The keen reproach cut deep, and for a moment he
found no words for reply, only followed her eyes to the
scene where Madame Ray, magnificently beautiful in<span class="pagenum">[114]</span>
white brocade and diamonds, was the center of an emotional
scene.</p>

<p>“What a fascinating woman! It is the star, of
course?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Yes; it is Madame Ray. She is more than fascinating.
She is an angel,” his daughter returned, warmly.</p>

<p>“May I ask how long you have known the lady?”</p>

<p>Cinthia looked around at him, and answered, perversely:</p>

<p>“Long enough to love her better than any one else
that I know.”</p>

<p>“Is she so charming?”</p>

<p>“Adorable!”</p>

<p>“And Mrs. Varian?” anxiously.</p>

<p>“I hate her!” Cinthia answered, frankly, with a flash
of the eyes.</p>

<p>“Because she parted you from Arthur?” he asked,
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes,” mutinously.</p>

<p>“Ah, Cinthia, in that act she only showed you truest
kindness.”</p>

<p>“She hated my mother!”</p>

<p>“And with good reason!” he replied, with a transient
flash in his dark blue eyes.</p>

<p>Cinthia looked suddenly curious.</p>

<p>“I should like to hear all about it!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Ah, my child, it is too sad a story for your ears, that
old feud. I pray Heaven you need never hear it all. We<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>
will go away to-morrow, and bury the dead past forever,”
he answered, earnestly, while he wondered over and over
how she had formed Madame Ray’s acquaintance, though
he saw that in her present perverse mood she would disclose
nothing.</p>

<p>They both watched the stage in silence for some moments,
then she startled him by saying:</p>

<p>“I believe my kind friend Madame Ray would help
me to become an actress if I insist upon it. Would you
consent?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. I have other plans for you,” he answered,
with instant decision.</p>

<p>“But, I can not bear the idea of that boarding-school!
I give you fair notice that I am likely to run away from
it and drown myself.”</p>

<p>“Poor Cinthia, poor unhappy child!” and his voice
grew suddenly deep and tender, while he gazed with dim
eyes at her flushed, defiant face.</p>

<p>A great pity and sympathy rose in his heart for the
hapless girl whose life was blighted in its dawning by
a hopeless love.</p>

<p>He said to himself that he must rise superior to the
self-absorption of years and give time and thought to
brightening his daughter’s life.</p>

<p>Perhaps she might turn out more lovable than he had
ever dared hope; but even if not, there was his neglected
duty staring him in the face. He could not shirk it any
longer, now that Cinthia had cut adrift from the old life,<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
and had no one to depend on but him. He must win her
from the despair and desperation of her present mood to
contentment with life.</p>

<p>Speaking very gently and kindly, he said:</p>

<p>“If you think you can not endure the school, I must
make other plans for you. How would you like to travel
awhile?”</p>

<p>Her dark eyes gleamed with sudden interest, and she
cried, quickly:</p>

<p>“It would please me more than anything else you can
offer. I tell you frankly that I am wretched, and that
change of scene and constant excitement offer the only
panacea for my troubles.”</p>

<p>“You shall have it; and I pray Heaven it may effect
a cure. Listen, Cinthia, I have very agreeable news for
you.”</p>

<p>She looked at him with a slightly incredulous air, and
he continued:</p>

<p>“A relative of ours has recently left you a small fortune,
that will enable you to lead a very pleasant future
life according to your own wishes. I am appointed your
guardian, and you will have an income of ten thousand
a year.”</p>

<p>“Ten thousand a year!” gasped Cinthia, in surprise
and delight at her good luck, for it seemed a great fortune
to one who had been reared so plainly and frugally.</p>

<p>She was young and beautiful and always longed for
the pleasures that money could buy, and the sudden news<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>
that she was to realize her dream did indeed dazzle her so
that a smile came to her sad lips and a flash of pleasure
to her eyes.</p>

<p>Her father thought, cynically:</p>

<p>“Her sorrow did not lie so deep after all, and it will
easily be soothed by the gewgaws foolish women prize.
Well, I am glad that it is so.”</p>

<p>He resumed, cordially:</p>

<p>“I am glad of this good luck for you, Cinthia, for I
have never been rich myself, and my income has never
been more than half what yours is now, and that was
earned by diligent practice at the law. I had intended to
do my best toward brightening your sad young life, but
this legacy comes most opportunely to enable you to gratify
your desires.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am very grateful for it. Now I can seek constant
diversion to drown memory,” she answered, with a
long-drawn sigh that showed him she would not forget so
easily as he had hoped.</p>

<p>It did not occur to her to ask the name of the relative
who had left her so handsome a legacy, or to notice that
her father had not spoken of any one’s death. In her
eagerness she accepted her good fortune without curiosity,
and clasping her little hands in growing excitement, cried:</p>

<p>“Papa, I have always wished to cross the sea. Will you
take me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Cinthia; but should you not see something of
your own land first?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[118]</span></p>

<p>“That can wait, papa. My first wish is to put the
whole breadth of the world between me and Arthur
Varian.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps that will be best,” he assented; for her words
touched an aching chord in his own heart.</p>

<p>Who could know better the aching pangs of love and
loss than Everard Dawn, who had tasted both to the bitter
dregs?</p>

<p>And how could he blame any one for the mad instinct
of flight from memory when he had been a restless exile
weary years for no better reason?</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The curtain fell to the crash of orchestra music and
the crowded building began to be emptied and the lights
turned low.</p>

<p>Both rose, and Cinthia’s father said, abruptly:</p>

<p>“Shall we return to the hotel? Or would you like to
go on to New York to-night to get ready for sailing on the
first steamer?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[119]</span></p>

<p>“We will go to New York to-night, but first let me go
and say farewell to my dear friend Madame Ray,” she
said, hurrying to the greenroom.</p>

<p>Everard Dawn went out and sent a note to Mrs. Varian,
while he waited for his daughter.</p>

<p>It ran simply:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I found Cinthia at the theater, and we go on at once
to New York, to sail this week for Europe, by her earnestly
expressed wish. In change of scene and the rush of
excitement she will seek oblivion of this painful episode
in her life.</p>

<p class="ir2 pminus1">“E. D.”</p>
</div>

<p>Presently Cinthia came to him from Madame Ray’s
dressing-room, where she had spent a long half hour, and
her father saw that the dew of tears hung heavily on the
thick fringe of her dark lashes. Wondering greatly at
this mysterious friendship, he drew her hand through his
arm and led her away to the new life that lay before her
in the untried future.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A QUARREL WITH FATE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Mrs. Flint would have been very lonely after her
brother’s departure, but for the fact that she had her
hands and her mind both full with helping the nurse to
care for the poor wayfarer so strangely thrown on her
hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[120]</span></p>

<p>As it was, her anxiety over Cinthia was soon dissipated
by the receipt of a telegram from Mr. Dawn, announcing
that he had found his daughter safe in Washington, and
that they would go on a trip to New York.</p>

<p>Several days later a short letter followed the telegram,
saying they had concluded to take a run over to Europe
for an indefinite stay. He believed that change of scene
was the best way to wean Cinthia from her infatuation for
Arthur Varian.</p>

<p>No mention was made of the legacy that had so opportunely
fallen to Cinthia, but Mr. Dawn inclosed a liberal
check to his sister, and asked that she would use some of
it in behalf of the woman he had brought home that night,
stating that he had recognized in her a former servant of
Cinthia’s mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flint began to take considerable more interest in
the invalid when she learned this interesting fact.</p>

<p>She had always cherished a lively curiosity over Cinthia’s
mother, and it had never been properly gratified, but
the little knowledge she had made her thirsty for more.
That she was beautiful, vain, and unprincipled, Everard
Dawn had acknowledged; but he did not even possess a
picture of her, although Mrs. Flint fancied he must have
loved her well from the way he had exiled himself at her
death.</p>

<p>She was anxious for the sick woman’s recovery, for
she fancied the woman could tell her more of Everard’s<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
dead wife than her brother had ever chosen to divulge
himself.</p>

<p>So she was unremitting in her care, as were also Doctor
Savoy and the trained nurse; but for several weeks the
woman’s life hung on a thread, and it was evident that
exposure of that wintery night had been preceded by keen
privation and almost starvation, making her hold on life
so frail that she had almost let it go.</p>

<p>It was far into December before she became convalescent
enough to impart her name and some curt information
about herself.</p>

<p>“My name is Rachel Dane, and I came from Florida
in search of work,” she said, rather sullenly; adding:
“I’m a capital sick-nurse, but I could get no more work
of that kind, and I thought I’d hire out for a ladies’-maid,
or even a cook, for I can do anything I have a mind to
turn my hand to.”</p>

<p>Old Doctor Savoy to whom she was talking, smiled
benevolently, and beaming on Mrs. Flint, remarked:</p>

<p>“I don’t think you’ll have to fare any further for a
job as maid of all work when you get strong enough, for
my old friend here certainly needs a good domestic, now
that she isn’t as young as she once was.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Flint had never thought of the subject in that
way before, but when her old friend, Doctor Savoy, presented
it so artfully to her mind, she consented to the
plan, knowing that she would be very lonely in the quiet<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
house, now that willful Cinthia’s bright presence was removed.</p>

<p>So when the snows of Christmas lay deep on the
ground, the new servant was up and about the little house,
serving her new mistress skillfully and well, but preserving
a rather sullen and taciturn demeanor, as if somehow
she had a quarrel with fate and could not be reconciled to
some scurvy trick it had played upon her now or in past
days.</p>

<p>While Mrs. Flint was wondering how to put to her
some plain questions as to her service with her brother’s
wife, Rachel Dane forestalled her by saying, in a sort of
casual way:</p>

<p>“When I got off the train at the station, I saw a man
I used to know—Mr. Everard Dawn. Does he live hereabout?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Mrs. Flint.</p>

<p>“Visiting, maybe?” with veiled anxiety.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Oh! At whose house?”</p>

<p>“At mine; but he has gone to Europe, now,” returned
Mrs. Flint, succinctly.</p>

<p>The woman started, and muttered some inaudible
words, as though she had received an unpleasant surprise.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you don’t know that it was Everard Dawn—my
brother—who brought you in here out of the snow
that night?” added Mrs. Flint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[123]</span></p>

<p>“So he saved my life,” Rachel Dane muttered, grimly;
“and you say he is your brother, Mrs. Flint?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and he told me he recognized you as a former
servant. Is it true?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I lived with Mrs. Dawn two years. It was when
her eldest child was born—before they left the South
and moved North. I suppose she has several children
now, ma’am?” with eager inquiry.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flint stared at her in surprise.</p>

<p>“Then you haven’t heard—you don’t know—that
Mrs. Dawn died when little Cinthia was five years old
and there never was any other child?”</p>

<p>“Dead! Mrs. Dawn dead!” the woman cried with
sharp regret, while a spasm of pain passed over her face,
and she sprung excitedly to her feet.</p>

<p>“You must have been very fond of her,” remarked
Mrs. Flint, curiously.</p>

<p>“Fond of her! Oh, yes, naturally. I lived with her
some time, you see, as maid of all work. Mr. Dawn
wasn’t rich then, but perhaps he’s better off now,” with
keen interest.</p>

<p>“No, and never will be; for it sort of took the heart
out of him when Cinthia’s mother died. He brought me
the child to raise, and went off wandering over the world
to drown his sorrow.”</p>

<p>Rachel Dane’s glum face related in surprise, as she
exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[124]</span></p>

<p>“Humph! I never thought he was so fond of her as
that! All the love seemed to be on her side!”</p>

<p>“So she was fond of him?”</p>

<p>“Fond ain’t no word for it. She just worshiped the
ground he walked on. Her sun rose and set in him. She
was grateful for a smile or a kind word, and mighty
few she got for all that; for of all the glum, moody men
I ever saw, Mr. Dawn was the worst. I believe he hated
his own life!”</p>

<p>“It was a guilty conscience maybe,” suggested Mrs.
Flint, watching her out of the corner of her eye, to see
how much she knew.</p>

<p>“You mean that he had treated his first wife bad for
her sake—yes, maybe it was remorse. I don’t rightly
know the facts, but I heard whispers,” answered Rachel
Dane, coolly; adding: “There was something strange
about it—his indifference to his wife, even after the
child was born, that she thought would bring them
closer together. But, la,” bringing herself up with a
jerk, “this is all guesswork on my part. Maybe he loved
her in a reserved kind of way. Anyway, I’m mighty
sorry she’s dead. But where’s the child?”</p>

<p>“Cinthia? Her father came and took her away while
you were sick. They have gone to Europe.”</p>

<p>“There! the kettle’s boiling over!” exclaimed Rachel
Dane, rushing to the stove; and after that she avoided the
subject of the deceased Mrs. Dawn.</p>

<p>But there could be no doubt that she was sincerely<span class="pagenum">[125]</span>
sorry over her death, for she became glummer and more
taciturn from that hour, and her quarrel with fate grew
more bitter.</p>

<p>But she stayed on and on with the lonely widow, giving
good service, and perhaps grateful for the comfortable
home she enjoyed, while she certainly relieved the loneliness
of the quiet home that echoed no more to the girlish
footsteps of Cinthia.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flint missed the girl more than she could have
deemed possible. She had secret spasms of remorse over
the rigid life she had led the poor girl, all on account
of having had a poor opinion of her mother.</p>

<p>“I was trying to bring her up right, so she might not
follow in her mother’s footsteps; but maybe I was too
hard on her,” she mused, “and if I had her back here,
I’d try to act a little different to the poor girl. Still, I
can’t think that anything I did to her was half as bad as
Everard’s refusing to let her marry Arthur Varian. To
the day of my death that’ll be a mystery to me why he
refused such a good chance for Cinthy. A poor girl like
her ain’t never going to get such another offer. And
they do say that since the Varians came back to Idlewild,
that Arthur looks like a ghost. Mrs. Bowles says they
have a house-party for Christmas, with lots of awful
pretty girls, but that he don’t care for any of them,
though his proud mother’s trying her hardest to marry
him off to one of them. Well, well, maybe his luck and<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>
Cinthy’s may turn, and they’ll marry yet. I do hope so,
for I love to see a girl marry her first love.”</p>

<p>There was one thing about her hand-maid that did not
altogether please the pious Mrs. Flint.</p>

<p>She discovered that Rachel Dane was wholly irreligious.</p>

<p>She neither attended church, read the Bible, nor said
her prayers at night—three facts that quite shocked her
employer.</p>

<p>In kindly remonstrating with the woman, the widow
found out that she cherished a grievance.</p>

<p>Her quarrel with fate was poverty.</p>

<p>“I will not worship a Being who makes such a difference
between His creatures, blessing some with riches
and happiness, and cursing others with poverty and woe,”
she said, rebelliously.</p>

<p>And all Mrs. Flint’s pious arguments made no change
in her mood. She only answered, flatly:</p>

<p>“I beg that you will not waste arguments on me,
ma’am. I’ve heard all that before, and it don’t alter my
opinion at all.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Flint found out that the desire of the woman’s
heart was to have a snug little fortune of her own, and
she would never have a good opinion of the Lord until
her desire was gratified.</p>

<p>One day, while she was looking out of the front window,
she saw Arthur Varian going past in a sleigh with
his mother, the silver bells ringing out gayly as they sped<span class="pagenum">[127]</span>
over the snow, while their rich fur robes and seal-skin
garments gave evidence of their wealth and position.</p>

<p>“Who are those grand, rich people?” she asked, enviously.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flint told her, and added with pardonable pride,
that the young man had been a suitor for Cinthia’s hand,
but her father had separated the lovers.</p>

<p>“He was very foolish, unless he had some good reason,”
exclaimed Rachel Dane.</p>

<p>“He did not have any good reason that I could find
out,” returned Mrs. Flint; adding, regretfully: “It would
have been a splendid match for Cinthia. I have heard
that Arthur’s grandfather, a Southern planter, left him a
million dollars in his own right.”</p>

<p>“I wish I knew how to get some of it from him!”
murmured Rachel Dane, gazing with covetous eyes after
the vanishing sleigh with its fortunate occupants.</p>

<p>And no thought crossed her mind that she was the
possessor of a secret that the rich Arthur Varian would
have sacrificed his whole great fortune to know.</p>

<p>One golden July day almost three years later than the
events of our last chapter, a little group of three persons
stood on the deck of a steamer homeward-bound, plowing
her way through the blue waves toward the harbor of
New York.</p>

<p>They were Everard Dawn, his daughter, and her
friend, Madame Ray, the latter having joined them
abroad three months ago, after a long correspondence,
dating from the time of their meeting in Washington on
the occasion of the frustrated elopement.</p>

<p>The actress had retired from the stage at last with a
fair competency, declaring that she was weary of the
exciting life, and desired to spend the rest of her days
in quiet, away from the glare of the foot-lights. At Cinthia’s
wish, she had gone abroad in the spring, traveling
with her young friend for several months, while every
day of their companionship added to the strength of the
bond of affection between their responsive hearts.</p>

<p>“I love you more than any one else in the world,” Cinthia
had said to her ardently more than once.</p>

<p>And the actress had answered as ardently:</p>

<p>“And I you, my dear. I wish you were my daughter.”</p>

<p>The words put a new thought in Cinthia’s head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[129]</span></p>

<p>Why couldn’t clear, beautiful Madame Ray become her
mamma?</p>

<p>What was to hinder her father falling in love with the
charming woman, and making her Mrs. Dawn, and thereby
her step-mamma?</p>

<p>Cinthia felt sure that she could love her as dearly as
her own mamma—much more dearly, in fact, than she
did her father.</p>

<p>For, though she saw a hundred admirable things about
him, and felt rather proud of him than otherwise, Cinthia
had never tried to overcome her resentment of the
past for those years of neglect, and the cruel parting
from her lover. She believed that Mr. Dawn and Mrs.
Varian had acted a wicked part in preventing her marriage,
because of some old family feud that would have
been healed by her union with Arthur.</p>

<p>So she still preserved toward her father a certain
amount of reserve, like a thin crust of ice, and he, on
his part, although admiring her grace and beauty, and
sedulously careful and attentive to all her whims, still
brooded over secret sorrows that made him half oblivious
to the present with the best of his heart buried in the dead
past.</p>

<p>To Cinthia there came the sudden thought that to make
a match between this strange father of hers and lovely
Madame Ray might be conducive to the happiness of all
three. Of herself she was sure that life would be far
brighter with this fair woman for a companion than spent<span class="pagenum">[130]</span>
alone with Everard Dawn, who would always represent
to her the blighting of the fairest love-dream maiden ever
cherished.</p>

<p>She became the most designing little match-maker in
the world, but she was so transparent that she could not
hide her plans from the objects of her care.</p>

<p>They detected her schemes with secret amusement,
and pretended unconsciousness, while inwardly rather
amused at the little by-play. That each admired the
other was natural, but it was not the admiration that
deepens into love. Both had been deeply bereaved in a
way that left no room for the budding of a second
passion.</p>

<p>As for Cinthia, those years abroad had been like the
bursting of a promising bud into a perfect flower.</p>

<p>In a few months she would be twenty years old, and
the promise of seventeen was more than fulfilled.</p>

<p>Her slight figure was somewhat taller and more
rounded in its gracious contour, and her lovely face and
large, soft, dark eyes had gained a depth of expression—spirit
blended with pathos—almost irresistible.</p>

<p>The gold of her luxurious, curling hair had a deeper,
richer sheen as it rippled in a loose knot beneath the brim
of her becoming little hat, a Parisian affair that matched
her stylish traveling gown, for Cinthia had developed
a perfect taste in dress that was very gratifying to her
father’s pride.</p>

<p>Wherever she moved, she was the cynosure of admiring<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
eyes, and a score of hearts had been laid at her feet—some
of them most true and manly; but she turned from
them with indifference, saying to herself that her life was
spoiled by Arthur’s falsity, and she could never love
again.</p>

<p>She called it Arthur’s falsity, always refusing to believe
that there existed any better reason than a former
feud between their parents for the breaking of their
troth.</p>

<p>She believed that Arthur was a coward, that he had
too easily given her up; but for all that she had not ceased
to love him, though she did not acknowledge this to her
own heart.</p>

<p>If you had asked her the question, she would have
sworn to you that she hated and despised Arthur Varian
and would not have forgiven him the slight he had put
on her if he had implored her on bended knees, so strong
is woman’s pride.</p>

<p>Yet, so weak is woman’s heart that she shrined his
image still in its deepest depths, and could not bid
memory down—memory of the brief, blissful time of
love when the world seemed to hold nothing for either
save the other, when they had tried to thrust aside, with
the passionate obstinacy of youth, every obstacle to their
happiness.</p>

<p>“If Arthur had been as brave as I was, less under the
control of his mother, we might have been so happy!”<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
she had said, regretfully, more than once to Madame
Ray, who agreed with her views, and always answered:</p>

<p>“You are right, dear. He was weak and cowardly,
unworthy of such a golden heart as yours. I would forget
him!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I will forget him. I despise him now!” Cinthia
answered out of her wounded pride.</p>

<p>Yet, as the prow of their noble steamer cleaved the
blue waves, and she stood on deck under the blue sky
and burning sun of July, her thoughts went before to her
native land and to her lost lover, so dearly loved, so
strangely lost.</p>

<p>She wondered where he was now, and if he was married
yet, for Aunt Flint, in one of her letters, had not
failed to mention that there was such a report in the
town. She added that it would not be Mrs. Varian’s
fault if her son did not find a wife, for she kept Idlewild
full of visitors the year round, when she was at home,
with pretty girls of all complexions, from brunette to
blonde.</p>

<p>Cinthia’s thoughts often wandered to Idlewild, wondering
what was transpiring there, and trying to picture
to herself the beauty of the gay young girls with whom
Mrs. Varian surrounded her son, trying to win his love
from Cinthia. It filled the girl’s heart with secret, jealous
agony that brought shadows of pain into her large,
soft eyes as she leaned against the rail and watched the
dancing waves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[133]</span></p>

<p>“How grave you look, Miss Dawn, while every one
else is rejoicing at the home-coming. One would think
you had left your heart behind you on foreign shores!”
gayly exclaimed a young man, approaching her and gazing
at her with admiring eyes.</p>

<p>He was a young New Yorker—one of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeunesse
dorée</i>—returning home after three months’ absence. On
the first day out he had fallen a victim to Cinthia’s
charms, and gladly renewed a former acquaintance with
Madame Ray, in order to secure an introduction to the
beauty.</p>

<p>As the actress knew him to be in every respect a most
desirable <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parti</i>, she was very glad to present him to Cinthia,
secretly hoping that he might manage to supplant
Arthur Varian in her tender heart.</p>

<p>Cinthia certainly found him interesting, he was so
good-looking, with his six feet of athletic manhood,
flashing dark eyes, and jetty hair and mustache, while
with his ready flow of small-talk he was very amusing.
She accepted his patent admiration and his respectful attentions
with the coolness of a belle accustomed to adulation,
letting him entertain her when she chose, and carelessly
dismissing him when not in the mood.</p>

<p>Her mood was not very propitious now, and it was a
very cold smile she gave in answer to his remark that
she must have left her heart behind on foreign shores.</p>

<p>“All the heart I have I brought back with me, although
I must confess to a fondness for the Old World,”<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>
she answered; adding: “I am not enthusiastic over my
return, because I have really no near relatives in America,
and papa and I intend to resume our wanderings in
our own country after a short rest.”</p>

<p>Frederick Foster exclaimed, eagerly:</p>

<p>“May I be permitted to know where the foot of the
dove will first rest?”</p>

<p>“I think we shall probably spend a few days at Newport
while maturing our plans,” Cinthia answered, carelessly.</p>

<p>Foster’s handsome countenance beamed with frank delight.</p>

<p>He cried, joyously:</p>

<p>“To Newport? How glad I am! Why, that is where
I am going.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?” smiled Cinthia.</p>

<p>“Yes, if you do not forbid my following you there,
which I should certainly do, even if I had not already
made my plans. Oh, please don’t frown upon me so, for,
indeed I have promised my aunt and cousin—who are
there from the South—that I will stay there with them
a while. In fact, I shouldn’t be surprised if Arthur came
to New York just to meet me.”</p>

<p>Arthur—Arthur! The name struck her sharply, like
a blow. She shut her lips tightly, and turned her head
aside, lest he should see the mortal paleness that she felt
overspreading it, while she chided herself for her weakness.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Suddenly a great shout arose from the crowd on deck.</p>

<p>They were steaming majestically into port, and on the
shore they saw eager throngs of friends waiting to welcome
their loved ones home.</p>

<p>Answering shouts came back from the pier, and handkerchiefs
were waved while glad tears started into many
eyes, it was such a glorious thing to be safe in port, having
weathered all the dangers of the sea.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Do you see any familiar faces on the pier, Miss
Dawn?” queried Frederick Foster, wondering why Cinthia
had turned her lovely face away so abruptly.</p>

<p>She looked back at him, pale, but composed.</p>

<p>“No, there is no one that I know,” she answered; and
in spite of her pride, her lip quivered.</p>

<p>It was such a dreary home-coming, after all, with no
one to welcome her and smile a glad welcome. She felt
a keen pang of envy of the happier ones by whom she
was surrounded.</p>

<p>Madame Ray and Mr. Dawn came up to them, and the
actress said with a little smothered sigh:</p>

<p>“What a scene of joyous excitement and confusion!<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
Parents waiting to greet sons and daughters, lovers to
greet sweethearts! I am almost sad that there is no one
to welcome us, Cinthia!”</p>

<p>“Madame, you are mistaken on your part,” laughed
Foster. “I see a group of reporters with their eyes
fixed on you already, and only waiting till the gang-plank
is thrown out to rush upon you, demanding to know if it
is not likely you will return to the stage again. To-morrow
morning they will report in their papers that you
have returned from Europe more beautiful than ever
from your long rest, and with a new play that will charm
the theater-going public this winter.”</p>

<p>Madame Ray darted behind him, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Do help me to escape them. I do not wish to be interviewed.
I belong to private life now.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Dawn, will you kindly help the madame to escape
the newspaper men, and I will lead Miss Dawn
ashore,” exclaimed Frederick Foster, coolly drawing Cinthia’s
arm through his, and rushing forward with the
tumultuous throng as the gang-plank was thrown out.</p>

<p>Oh, what a Babel of noise and confusion! but through
it all Cinthia could hear the young man whispering ardent
words to her, vowing that the past week had been the
happiest of his life, that he adored her, and would ask
no greater joy than to walk with her through life arm in
arm as now, heedless of the rushing, jostling throng.</p>

<p>Would she give him one little word of hope to live <a id="Ref_136" href="#BRef_136">on</a><span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
till they met again at Newport? He knew he was presumptuous,
but love was his excuse.</p>

<p>“Oh, you must not talk to me any more like this. I—I——”
began Cinthia in confusion; but just at that moment
they stepped on <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra-firma</i>, and came face to face
with a young man waiting there with a lady on his arm,
at sight of whom Foster whispered to his companion:</p>

<p>“My aunt and cousin, the Varians!”</p>

<p>Sky and earth, and sea seemed to jumble and blend together
in Cinthia’s confused consciousness as her startled
eyes met the equally surprised ones of Arthur Varian.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“I CAN NOT LOVE AGAIN!”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was the most surprising and unwelcome <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rencontre</i>
in the world, that meeting between those four, Everard
Dawn and his daughter and Mrs. Varian and her son.</p>

<p>Frederick Foster was the son of Mrs. Varian’s eldest
sister, long since dead, and therefore peculiarly dear to
her, so that wherever he went, he always kept up a correspondence
with Arthur, of whom he was very fond. So
it chanced that they had written him while he was abroad
of their sojourn at Newport, and begged him to join them
there on his return.</p>

<p>Later on the mother and son decided to meet him at<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>
the steamer, as he might feel it a lonely home-coming,
his father also being dead, and his two married sisters
being absent from the city.</p>

<p>From the pier they had recognized Frederick on the
steamer’s deck, but as he stood in front of his three companions,
they had not been identified, otherwise Arthur
would have gone away to avoid a meeting.</p>

<p>It seemed to Mrs. Varian as if a most malignant fate
had sent them there when she lifted her eyes and saw before
her Frederick, her handsome nephew, arm in arm
with Cinthia, while behind them walked Everard Dawn
with the beautiful Madame Ray.</p>

<p>It was a painful, almost a tragic <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rencontre</i>, and entirely
unavoidable, for Frederick Foster, unconscious of
anything wrong, cried out almost boisterously:</p>

<p>“How do you do, my dear aunt? Happy to see you,
Arthur!” embracing them with effusion, and adding, to
the pale, silent girl who clung to his arm: “Miss Dawn,
let me present my aunt, Mrs. Varian, and my cousin, Arthur
Varian.”</p>

<p>A moment of shocked embarrassment was followed by
formal greetings—greetings as of strangers who had
never met before.</p>

<p>Mrs. Varian and Cinthia simply bowed to each other,
both pale and cold, but Arthur held out his hand, saying,
almost inaudibly:</p>

<p>“I am glad to meet you.”</p>

<p>Cinthia bowed without speaking, and gave him her icy<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
fingers in response. Their hands just touched and fell
apart, and their faces were as pale as they would ever
be in their coffins.</p>

<p>Frederick Foster, without observing anything unusual
in the air, proceeded to present the others.</p>

<p>“Mr. Dawn and Madame Ray, let me present my aunt
and cousin, Mrs. Varian and her son.”</p>

<p>Again there were cold, surprised bows on either side,
and the next moment Frederick found that Cinthia’s
fingers had dropped from his arm, and the heedless, jostling,
happy throng had closed in between the two little
groups, cutting them off from each other.</p>

<p>“Oh, I say!” he cried, in dismay, “we have quite lost
my friends. Will you excuse me one moment while I
follow and bid them good-bye?”</p>

<p>But Arthur answered in a troubled voice:</p>

<p>“My mother is almost fainting, Fred. Will you help
me take her to the carriage?”</p>

<p>It was quite true what Arthur said. Mrs. Varian’s
proud, dark head had drooped heavily against his shoulder,
and her face was marble-pale, with half-closed eyes,
while her breath came in slow, labored gasps.</p>

<p>Somehow, the sight of Everard Dawn with the beautiful
actress by his side had given her an almost insupportable
shock.</p>

<p>Frederick Foster instantly became all anxiety and attention,
and with Arthur’s assistance he supported her to
the waiting carriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[140]</span></p>

<p>She leaned back among the cushions with shut eyes,
while Arthur stroked her brow and hands with tender
touches, and her nephew exhausted himself in wondering
what had made her ill.</p>

<p>Arthur answered evasively:</p>

<p>“It must have been the great heat of the sun. She
complained of the warmth of the weather while we were
watching the steamer come into port.”</p>

<p>The carriage rolled along toward their hotel, and Mrs.
Varian grew gradually better, opening her eyes presently
and faintly apologizing for the fright she had given them.</p>

<p>“I am almost well again, and I think we can return to
Newport to-night,” she said.</p>

<p>Foster’s thoughts recurred again to his friends, and he
exclaimed, regretfully:</p>

<p>“I am very sorry that I lost sight of my friends, the
Dawns and Madame Ray. They, too, are going to Newport,
and if I only knew at what hotel they intended to
stop, I would go and persuade them to make a party with
us going there.”</p>

<p>“Please do not, Fred. They might think us officious,
being strangers,” Mrs. Varian cried, hastily.</p>

<p>Frederick laughed roguishly, and answered:</p>

<p>“I serve notice on you that you will not be strangers
long, for I intend to make Miss Dawn your niece, if she
will give her consent!”</p>

<p>“Ah!” cried Arthur, in a strange tone of suppressed<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>
emotion; but Frederick did not notice, he was so absorbed
in the thought of Cinthia.</p>

<p>“Did you notice how radiantly beautiful she was?”
he cried. “She is as graceful and stately as a young
princess, and her feet and hands are exquisitely small and
dainty. Her hair is a shower of gold, and such beautiful,
large, soft dark eyes, so haunting and mesmeric, I never
saw in another woman’s face. The first moment I met
their full glance, I realized that all was over with Frederick
Foster.”</p>

<p>“How long have you known the young lady, Fred?”
his aunt asked.</p>

<p>“Only from the first day we sailed for New York; but
the moment I saw her I was done for, and I believe if I
had not secured an introduction to her soon, I should have
jumped overboard and drowned myself. Oh, I tell you,
it was a case of love at first sight—on my side, at least. I
don’t know how it is with her; but I was actually proposing
to her as we came down the gang-plank and met
you, so I did not get her answer. But I shall at Newport,
of course. But, as I was saying, I got an introduction
through the lovely actress, Madame Ray, who had been
with them several months in Europe. She has retired
from the stage now, and I’m rather sorry. I’ve known
her several years, and she was an ornament to the profession—as
good a woman as ever stepped.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she is going to marry Miss Dawn’s father?”
ventured his aunt, inquiringly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[142]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know. They would make a splendid couple,
wouldn’t they? And I know that the lovely Cinthia
would give anything to bring it about. She is devoted
to the charming actress.”</p>

<p>“How I hate that girl!” Mrs. Varian thought, with
secret, irrepressible bitterness.</p>

<p>“They are all coming to Newport, and I hope you and
Arthur will find them as charming as I do—only Arthur
must not fall in love with my princess,” continued Foster,
blithely.</p>

<p>Arthur only laughed, and just then the carriage drew
up at the entrance to their hotel.</p>

<p>As Arthur was helping his mother out, she whispered:</p>

<p>“If they come to Newport, we will go away the same
day.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the other party, quite as much disconcerted,
had sought another hotel.</p>

<p>Cinthia lay sobbing on a low couch, and Madame Ray
knelt by her side, caressing her and murmuring low words
of comfort.</p>

<p>“Do not think of him, my darling. He is not worthy
of one regret. Only a coward would have deserted you
as Arthur Varian did. I am sorry that Fred Foster is
his cousin, but that need not matter. He loves you very
much, and I would be charmed to see you marry this
manly young man.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can never love again! My heart was broken
by Arthur’s falsity!” moaned Cinthia, sobbing in unrestrained<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
grief that she would not have shown to any
one on earth but this sympathetic friend she loved so
well.</p>

<p>“Forget him, dear,” the other answered, as she had
often done before, laying the golden head caressingly
against her breast, and kissing the tears from the sad,
dark eyes.</p>

<p>When Cinthia had sobbed herself into calmness, she
said:</p>

<p>“Of course, we will not go to Newport now. I must
not meet them again.”</p>

<p>“No, we must not go to Newport now,” Madame Ray
agreed; adding: “I shall go on from New York to my
home in Florida—a pretty estate left to me last year by
an old maiden aunt—and, Cinthia, I want you and your
father to come with me as my guests.”</p>

<p>“But perhaps we ought to go and visit Aunt Flint
first,” suggested Cinthia.</p>

<p>“No; for you are in danger of meeting the Varians
there.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” sighed Cinthia.</p>

<p>“So you will promise to come with me, dear?”</p>

<p>“If papa is willing.”</p>

<p>When Mr. Dawn was consulted, he accepted the invitation
for Cinthia, saying that he had business that would
take him to California for a short while, but would join
them later in the South.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“THE PANGS THAT REND MY HEART IN TWAIN!”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Madame Ray despised Arthur Varian so much that she
was bitterly chagrined on learning that he was related
to her favorite, Frederick Foster, whom she hoped to see
Cinthia marry.</p>

<p>Foster had frankly confided his hopes to the actress,
and elicited her sympathy in his love. She had promised
to do all she could to help him win Cinthia, and it annoyed
her very much that, for a time at least, the ardent
lover would be debarred from seeing the object of his
love.</p>

<p>Perhaps, too, if he should find out that love episode
with his cousin Arthur, he would not wish to marry a
girl who had been so cruelly deserted on the eve of marriage.
She guessed wrongly that the Varians would very
likely use all their influence against Cinthia.</p>

<p>But, however much she worried, she could see no way
out of the dilemma. Foster had been abruptly parted
from Cinthia before he had taught her to love him, and
she saw no safe way of bringing them together again in
the present. Time alone could solve the problem.</p>

<p>It was a great disappointment not to be able to take
Cinthia to Newport, where she knew that the girl’s grace
and beauty would create a sensation; but, of course, it
was not to be thought of now. Cinthia and Arthur
Varian must be kept apart for the sake of the young
girl’s peace of mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[145]</span></p>

<p>But how handsome and manly he had looked—not at
all like the weak coward Madame Ray deemed him. She
found herself dwelling with pleasure on his handsome
face and form, his dark-blue eyes, and brown, clustering
hair.</p>

<p>“Much after the style of Cinthia’s handsome father.
I fancy he might have looked like that when he was a
young man, before the gray came into his brown locks,
and the anxious lines into his face,” she mused, thoughtfully;
and her eyes grew grave, and her cheek pale with
a sudden, startling thought that made her exclaim: “Good
heavens! <em>could</em> it be?”</p>

<p>The line of thought thus started was most distressing,
as evinced by the agitation of her face, and presently she
muttered:</p>

<p>“There may be a mystery, after all. I will try to get
at the bottom of it.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Cinthia, struggling with the heartache renewed
by her encounter with her lost love, or her false
love, as she preferred to call him, made a great effort to
throw off the weight on her spirits and become herself
again.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Cinthia could not thrust Arthur’s image from her heart
however much she tried and longed to do so. She could
wear the mask of pride over her sorrow, that was all.</p>

<p>Her father hoped and believed that she was overcoming
her trouble, and would have rejoiced as much as
Madame Ray if she could have transferred her heart to
Frederick Foster. He who had known the pangs of
wounded love so well was eager to find a cure for his
daughter’s heart.</p>

<p>But all chance of this had been temporarily frustrated
by her unexpected <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rencontre</i> with Arthur Varian.</p>

<p>He felt that all the old ground would have to be gone
over now again, and cursed the evil fates that had worked
against him.</p>

<p>He regretted that a sudden weariness of foreign shores
had decided him to return to America, and made up his
mind to take Cinthia away again out of reach of the
Varians. This was why he had said that he was going to
California.</p>

<p>He had decided to make a home for himself and daughter
under those blue and sunny skies, among orange groves
and bowers of bloom, where life would glide so softly<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
amid wooing zephyrs, that it would seem like an Arcadia
even to disappointed hearts like his own and Cinthia’s.
There they would win forgetfulness of the past and hope
for the future.</p>

<p>Madame Ray guessed not of the intentions of Everard
Dawn, or she would have been most unhappy at the
thought of parting from Cinthia.</p>

<p>With each day the girl grew dearer to her heart, and
it had become her secret fixed intention to make her
home near to Cinthia’s, wherever it should be, and never
lose sight of her again.</p>

<p>Her love for the fair young girl was a passion of devotion.
She would have sacrificed all she possessed to secure
her happiness.</p>

<p>Yet Cinthia seemed further away than ever from it
now.</p>

<p>“Ah, my darling, you should not brood so morbidly
over the past!” she cried, winding her arms around the
fair girl’s waist. “You have lost a lover, it is true; but
think how much more I have suffered, when scarcely as
old as you, losing a beloved husband and darling infant.”</p>

<p>“You have lost a child? Dear heart, how I pity you!”
Cinthia cried, tenderly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[148]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, Cinthia, I have lost a little daughter, who would
be as old as you are. It is for her sake I love you so
dearly, because you are motherless, and I, alas! childless.
It is a sad story, and some day I will tell it to you. Then
you will see that my sorrow is greater than yours,” sighed
the lovely actress.</p>

<p>Cinthia pressed her hand, and murmured:</p>

<p>“You had their love till they died, and in heaven they
are waiting to welcome you home, still your own, still
fond and true. But he I loved proved false, and another
may win him from me. Were it not better if he had really
died and belonged to me truly in heaven?”</p>

<p>Oh, how sad the pathetic voice, how mournful the
far-off gaze, piercing the listener’s heart like an arrow!</p>

<p>She cried out, bitterly:</p>

<p>“Ah, Cinthia, you know not the depth of my bereavement.
My husband is dead, it is true. I had his love
but a little while, but it was bliss while it was mine, and
I know it is waiting for me in heaven, but oh, Cinthia,
my little one, my baby—oh! oh! oh!” and she dissolved
in a passion of tears that startled Cinthia from her own
morbid grief and turned her to the task of the consoler.</p>

<p>Most gently, most fondly, most lovingly she caressed
the agitated mourner, murmuring to her of the beautiful
home, not made with hands, where her dead child was a
precious angel.</p>

<p>“Think what sorrows she may have escaped by her
early translation to heaven. Is it not better thus than<span class="pagenum">[149]</span>
to have reached girlhood, as I did, to have her faith and
love trampled in the dust, and her life saddened forever?”
she cried, earnestly.</p>

<p>“Ah, my dear, you do not understand. I had not
finished telling you. She—my little darling, my unnamed
daughter, did not die.”</p>

<p>“Not die!” Cinthia echoed, in bewilderment.</p>

<p>“No, she did not die, and I know not to this day
whether she is alive or dead. She—was stolen—from
me,” sobbed the bereaved mother, letting her head fall
on the sill of the open window where they were sitting.</p>

<p>Cinthia was so shocked for a moment that she could
not speak. She could only throw her arms about the
mourner and clasp her close with a love as true and
warm as if she had been the dear lost daughter.</p>

<p>The balmy summer breeze swept in caressingly over
the two fair heads nestled close together, while Madame
Ray sobbed:</p>

<p>“Now you understand why I love you so, my dear.
Not but that your own beauty and sweetness is enough
to charm any heart. But when I found you in Washington
that first day, a motherless girl scarcely past childhood,
forsaken by your lover, wretched, desperate, almost
driven to suicide, my heart went out to you in a passion
of pitying love as I thought, my own child, if alive, is no
older than this one. Who can tell but that she may be in
an even more grievous strait than this poor girl, whom<span class="pagenum">[150]</span>
I will try to advise and befriend, praying Heaven to deal
as kindly with my dear lost little one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you were an angel to me in that hour!” <a id="Ref_150" href="#BRef_150">cried</a>
Cinthia, eagerly, gratefully. “Oh, I was wretched and
desperate, as you say, weary of life and longing for death,
almost driven by my humiliation to the awful sin of suicide.
When I opened that door, intending to rush recklessly
into the streets, careless of my fate, what terrible
calamity might have happened me if I had not found you
standing like an angel on the threshold, sent by God Himself
to save me from myself. You drew me back, you
pitied and advised me, you made me a better girl than
I ever was before. And since that hour your love has
been to me more than words can express, my anchor of
hope in a stormy life, my refuge from despair, my haven
of love. Oh, I have been ungrateful, nursing my woe
in spite of all your goodness and patience. I will try to
be braver and stronger, indeed I will. I will always remember
the keen sorrows you have borne while you wore
a smile of comfort and cheer for me. And, oh, I pray
that God has given to your lost child as dear a comforter
as I have found in you.”</p>

<p>The words, poured forth in a passion of grateful emotion,
ended in a burst of sobs, and they mingled their
tears together and found subtle relief in each other’s
sympathy.</p>

<p>When they grew calmer, Madame Ray said softly in
her low, flute-like voice:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[151]</span></p>

<p>“I am glad indeed if I have been to you all that you
say, Cinthia, dear, for you were indeed in need of love
and care when we first met. I have lavished on you a
mother’s love, while you have repaid me with a daughter’s,
I know.”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes; but I could not fill up the void caused by
your own child’s loss.”</p>

<p>“You have been a great comfort to me, dear, and I
hope never to be parted from you in life unless you
marry, and even then, dear, I shall manage to see you
often, as a mother clings to a married daughter.”</p>

<p>“How I wish that you and papa would marry!” cried
the eager girl.</p>

<p>“My dear, do not nourish such a thought. It can
never be. I am sure that both our hearts are buried in
our dear ones’ graves.”</p>

<p>“It does not seem as if papa really loved my mother
much, or he would care more for me,” Cinthia exclaimed,
with the old resentment of her father’s strange indifference.</p>

<p>“My dear, do not judge him harshly. Mr. Dawn
looks to me like a man capable of strong affections, but
he also bears on his face the signs of tragic happenings
that have blighted the promise of his life. If you will
take my judgment for it, dearest, your father is a most
unhappy and weary man!” continued Madame Ray.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“A fairy land of flowers and fruits and sunshine</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And crystal lakes and overarching forests.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Oh, madame, what a perfect morning! There is
not the slightest cloud in the clear blue sky, and the sheen
of sunlight on the lake is dazzling. The air is odorous
with the scent of flowers, and the little birds are almost
splitting their throats with divine melody. What a contrast
to the bleakness of November in the North, or even
in my own loved Virginia, that three years ago I left in
the midst of a whirling snow-storm!” cried Cinthia
Dawn, as she walked out on the long broad gallery that
surrounded her friend’s Floridian home.</p>

<p>A fairer scene or a sweeter home would be hard to
find than the pretty estate that the actress had opportunely
inherited a year before from a deceased great
aunt.</p>

<p>It was situated in Marion County, on the suburbs of
the pretty village Weir Park, near the crystal Weir Lake
famed as being the prettiest lake in Florida, several miles
in extent, with a magnificent expanse of white sandy
beach glittering in the golden sunlight.</p>

<p>Lodge Delight was the suggestive name of the white
villa, surrounded by beautiful flowers and trees, where
Madame Ray had brought her beloved young guest, and<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>
for several months they had sojourned here almost happily
but for the haunting memories that made real happiness
impossible to either, even in so Eden-like a scene.</p>

<p>But at least they were devoted to each other, and led
an almost idyllic life in the beautiful health-giving country
so much sought in winter by visitors from the frozen
North, while Cinthia’s father still lingered in California,
though he wrote his daughter that she might expect him
now at any time.</p>

<p>When Cinthia and Madame Ray came out on the broad
rose-wreathed gallery of Lodge Delight, in their peerless
beauty, like the perfect rose and the unfolding bud,
they added the only wanting touch to the lovely scene—the
touch of human life.</p>

<p>The young girl’s beautiful dark eyes beamed with
fresh delight at the fair prospect spread before them,
while she cried out in rapture at the lovely day.</p>

<p>Madame Ray smiled with pleasure at the girl’s enthusiasm,
and answered:</p>

<p>“It is indeed beautiful, and I am rejoiced that you
love my home so well. It makes me grateful to my dead
aunt who left me this idyllic estate. It is quite too
lovely a day to spend indoors. What shall we do? Go
walking, driving, or rowing?”</p>

<p>Cinthia, with her golden head one side like a bird,
cogitated a moment, then decided on a long drive into
the country.</p>

<p>The carriage was ordered, and in a short while they<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>
were resting luxuriously among the cushions, while a
typical Florida darky handled the reins, and sent the
handsome black ponies spinning at a lively rate along
the road, past glistening orange-groves laden with golden
globes of fruit, and lovely homes where art and nature
combined to make an earthly paradise.</p>

<p>“Take us a new route,” Madame Ray had said to
him and he had chosen a most attractive one, keeping
them keenly interested all the while, until about three
miles out, Cinthia called to him, saying:</p>

<p>“Let the ponies rest a minute, Uncle Rube, while you
tell us about those picturesque ruins over there.”</p>

<p>They had just come opposite the remains of a once
palatial mansion that had been destroyed by fire, one of
the long stone wings still standing, a melancholy, dismantled
ruin through which voices of the past might fitly
echo with the raving of the night-winds. Around it were
neglected lawns and gardens, the shrubbery growing in
rank luxuriance about the broken fountains, whose tinkling
waters had once laughed in the sun. An air of
neglect, desertion and dreariness hung about the place, in
spite of all the brightness of the day and scene, that sent
a chill through the hearts of the gazers.</p>

<p>“What a magnificent place this must once have been,
and what a pity it has not been rebuilt! Who owns it,
Uncle Rube?” inquired Madame Ray, with deep interest,
and the old man said, with conscious pride:</p>

<p>“It b’longs to we—all—all dat’s leff ob ole marster’s<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>
fam’bly dat I use to b’long to. Dis place used to be de
country-seat ob de fam’bly, tell three years agone, when
it burned down, and de mistis moved ’way off to Virginia
to anurr gran’ place she had called Idlewhiles.”</p>

<p>Madame Ray and Cinthia both started violently, and
looked significantly at each other.</p>

<p>Then the actress recovered herself, and whispered:</p>

<p>“A mere coincidence. Dozens of places are called
Idlewild.”</p>

<p>The old negro let the reins rest on the horses’ glossy
backs, flicked a fly from one of their heads with his whip,
and continued, retrospectively:</p>

<p>“Dis place now dey name Love’s Retreat, an’ no
wonder, fer sech a place fer courtin’ an’ sparkin’ sho’ly
nebber was seen. Ole marster and mistis had four
chillun—two sons and two daughters—all four beautiful
as cud be, an’ all de young folks in de kentry used to be
comin’ an’ goin’ here; an’ de sparkin’ dat went on in dem
flower-gyardens an’ rose-arbors was a caution—you hear
me! Umme, but dem was gay times ’fore de war! But,
umme, when ’twas all ober, an’ Marse Captain Varian
comes home wid his arm gone, an’ his two sons dead on
de feil o’ battle, an’ de niggers all free, an’ eb’ryt’ing
gone to wrack an’ ruin, why, ole mistis nebber hole up
her head no more—she jest died, dey say, ob a broken
heart for her poor boys lost an’ gone. An’ bime-by de
oldest geerl she fell in lub wid a Yank she met up North,
an’ married him spite o’ all de ’jections ob old marse,<span class="pagenum">[156]</span>
who, naterally, hated de Yanks, dough dey say dat Marse
Fred Foster was a mighty fine gen’l’man, all de same, <em>an’</em>
rich as we all’s folks. But Miss P’liny—de youngest
geerl, she made a missallyance, too, so her pa said—up
an’ married a poor lawyer, an’ bime-by she got divossed
from him, an’ no wonder; it was a shame de way he
kerried on wid dat ward ob his, de brazen creeter! So
now, when marse captain died, five years ago, dey warn’t
no one left at Love’s Retreat but Mrs. Varian an’ her
little son. Dey travel ’bout a great deal now, so I’se
’feard dey’ll never build up dis ole place ag’in.”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“WHERE THE CLEMATIS BOUGHS INTWINE.”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Uncle Rube had rambled on heedlessly as though he
loved his subject while his hearers listened in painful
wonder; but now Madame Ray brought him up suddenly
by saying, nervously:</p>

<p>“That is enough, Uncle Rube. Drive on a few miles
further and we will return.”</p>

<p>A strange terror was stirring in her breast—terror
of some startling revelation that might shock Cinthia in
the old man’s rambling talk. She dared not let him
utter another word; but strange suspicions were
awakened in her breast, and she resolved to have a private
conversation with Uncle Rube to solve her doubts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[157]</span></p>

<p>One of his statements had struck her with peculiar
force.</p>

<p>He had spoken of Captain Varian’s youngest daughter’s
marriage and divorce from her husband.</p>

<p>In the next breath he had called her Mrs. Varian,
Varian being her maiden name.</p>

<p>Why did the divorced woman and her son both bear
the family name? And who was the divorced husband?
Of his name Madame Ray began to have a secret prescient
dread.</p>

<p>Was she about to stumble on the mystery that had sundered
Arthur’s and Cinthia’s lives?</p>

<p>She glanced nervously at Cinthia, but beyond a deep
pallor saw no sign of shock such as she had secretly experienced.
Feeling thankful that it was so, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Uncle Rube’s story has given me the horrors! How
sad to think of such a happy family so broken up by the
cruel, desolating war! But there were many such. One
could almost fancy the ghost of the past haunting that
desolate ruin!”</p>

<p>They looked back with troubled eyes at the wrecked
home that had sheltered Arthur Varian’s forefathers and
his own saddened youth. How strange that he should
thus be recalled to memory again when Cinthia was
just getting over their last ill-fated meeting.</p>

<p>She read Madame Ray’s perturbed thoughts and
feigned indifference, saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[158]</span></p>

<p>“It certainly gives one a sort of ghostly chill to gaze
on the ruins of such a home. Do you remember Byron’s
lines on his old home?” repeating softly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Through thy battlements, Newstead, the hollow winds whistle,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Thou, the halls of my fathers have gone to decay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In thy once smiling garden the hemlock and thistle</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Have choked up the rose which late bloomed in the way.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They rode on along the broad, level road, finding always
something new to admire, but they did not talk so
much or so brightly as before. Their faces were pale
and thoughtful, and a shadow had fallen on their spirits—the
shadow that always fell when they were reminded
of the Varians.</p>

<p>Memory was poison to their hearts.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“My heart hath but one passion</div>
    <div class="verse indent14">To forget.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Ah, is there nothing in the world then</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">To take away the soul’s divine regret?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But when they were returning along the same road,
both craned their necks eagerly toward the ruined home
which had aroused in them so much painful interest.</p>

<p>They looked half questioningly toward each other, and
Cinthia murmured:</p>

<p>“I—I—should like to walk among the ruins—should
you?”</p>

<p>“I am always walking among ruins—the ruins of a
life’s happiness,” the actress answered, sadly enough;
then added: “But yes, we can easily spare time to go<span class="pagenum">[159]</span>
through the place. Uncle Rube, are strangers permitted
to enter Love’s Retreat?”</p>

<p>“Oh, sartainly, mistis. De big gates ain’t never locked.
Anybody is free to go in and gather all de flowers dey
want. It seem to me like I seen some folkses dodgin’
’bout de trees when we went pas’, but guess dey’s all gone
now. Shall I drive you in at the kerridge road?”</p>

<p>“No; you may wait for us here in the shade of these
trees while we walk. We will return in fifteen minutes.”</p>

<p>They pushed open the wrought iron front gates that
clanged heavily to behind them, and turning from the
broad graveled walk, plunged into the miniature thickets
of blossoming shrubbery, shaking out odors of rose and
jasmine with the slightest touches as they walked along
toward a graceful little summer-house, heavily matted
with rich purple clematis bells starring the dark green
of the leaves.</p>

<p>“Let us go in,” said Madame Ray, stepping over the
threshold closely followed by Cinthia.</p>

<p>Then both recoiled with a startled cry.</p>

<p>Two young men in cycling suits were in the summer-house.</p>

<p>They had slipped in there to hide when they saw a
carriage stop at the gate and two ladies entering the
grounds.</p>

<p>“Sight-seers whom we do not know, I suppose, so
let us hide in here and finish our talk and our cigars till
they leave. I care no more for womankind, be she never<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>
so fair, since I have lost the lovely queen of my heart,”
one said to the other; so they fled the scene till it should
be safe to venture out.</p>

<p>He was dark and striking in appearance, the other
was fairer and younger than his companion by several
years. His clustering locks were light golden brown,
and the beauty of his face was enhanced by the expressive
dark-blue eyes, where shadows of secret sorrow seemed
to lurk in half-discovered ambush.</p>

<p>“Fred they are coming this way by their voices. Let
us turn our backs to the door, so that they will see we
are not anxious to be disturbed,” he said, presently.</p>

<p>“A good idea, Arthur,” and suiting the action to the
word, they presented two broad backs toward the new-comers,
who had barely stepped across the threshold ere
they recoiled, each with a stifled cry of surprise.</p>

<p>The Mother Eve that is in all men just as much as
in all women made the two smokers spring up and look
around at the intruders.</p>

<p>Then there were more startled exclamations all around.</p>

<p>For the fate that seemed to pursue Cinthia Dawn with
its cruelest irony had followed her even here.</p>

<p>She had fled from the far North to the far South to
escape Arthur Varian, and she had hoped never to gaze
again in life on his too fatally fascinating beauty—the
manly beauty that had lured the girlish heart from her
breast only to toss it back to her at the command of
cruel parents, who seemed to have forgotten the fervor<span class="pagenum">[161]</span>
of youthful love, or they never could have been so harsh
to their tortured children.</p>

<p>Yet, here stood Arthur Varian before her again—Arthur
Varian pale to the very lips, Arthur Varian with
unmasked despair in his beautiful, dark-blue eyes.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>But whatever cruel pain this unexpected meeting produced
on Arthur and Cinthia, its effect on Frederick
Foster was wholly joyful.</p>

<p>He could scarcely believe his own joyful sight when
he saw Cinthia again.</p>

<p>For weary months, ever since their abrupt parting on
the New York pier, she had been lost to him as wholly
as if she were already in her grave.</p>

<p>The most eager and anxious inquiry on his part had
failed to disclose her whereabouts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[162]</span></p>

<p>With genuine grief—for he was most passionately in
love with Cinthia—he had given up the hopeless quest,
realizing that nothing but blind chance would ever bring
them together again.</p>

<p>His pride was cruelly wounded, too, for he felt that if
Cinthia had cared for him, she must surely have sent
him an answer to the interrupted proposal he had made
while they were leaving the steamer arm in arm.</p>

<p>“I spoke too soon and just frightened the shy darling,
big, blundering fool that I was!” he thought, with keen
humiliation, though he knew perfectly well that many a
girl would have simply jumped at such a chance.</p>

<p>But he had realized that Cinthia was not one of them,
and made up his mind, if he ever met her again, to
besiege her heart with the most chivalrous wooing that
ever won a maiden.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the hope of his heart was suddenly realized by
the appearance of Cinthia at the door of the summer-house,<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
he fairly gasped with joy and surprise as he
sprung to meet her, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Do my anxious eyes deceive me, or is it Miss
Dawn?”</p>

<p>“You are not mistaken,” she answered, coldly, turning
her eyes from Arthur, whose presence she had acknowledged
by a slight and formal bow, and giving Frederick
Foster her hand.</p>

<p>He clasped it eagerly, almost forgetting Madame Ray,
who in her turn was greeting Arthur more cordially than
Cinthia had done.</p>

<p>For something in the woman’s deep nature was touched
to sympathy by the secret suffering evinced by his deathly
pale face and troubled eyes.</p>

<p>She said, gently:</p>

<p>“This is a surprise, Mr. Varian, meeting you here
among the picturesque ruins of your old home.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered, huskily; and she saw that he also
had received a great shock and was struggling for calmness.</p>

<p>She continued, trying to place him at his ease by saying:</p>

<p>“When our driver told us this morning to whom these
picturesque ruins belonged, we were quite surprised, and
took a fancy to explore them. I hope we are not intruding.
Of course we were not aware that any member
of the family was in the neighborhood.”</p>

<p>“There is no intrusion. I will take pleasure in showing<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
you around, Madame Ray,” he answered, in that deep
musical voice that so charmed every hearer; adding:
“My cousin and I only arrived last evening, and our
stay will be short, only long enough to make arrangements
for rebuilding Love’s Retreat.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” she said, and the thought came to her that
perhaps he was about to marry.</p>

<p>Perhaps he read the thought, for he flushed slightly
as he added:</p>

<p>“My mother wishes it, as she is very fond of Lake
Weir, and anxious to return to her old home. Fred and
I are stopping at Weir Park Hotel. Have you been long
in this neighborhood?”</p>

<p>“Yes, for several months. You see, it is my home
now. I inherited a little estate—Lodge Delight—from a
deceased great-aunt.”</p>

<p>“I knew your aunt well in my boyhood. She was a
friend of my mother’s, and Lodge Delight is little short
of fairy-land. You have Miss Dawn as a guest?”</p>

<p>“Yes, for a long time, I hope. Her father is in California.”</p>

<p>Fred Foster came up, beaming with joy and pride.</p>

<p>“Madame Ray, the gods have surely favored me.
Have you been hiding at Weir Park all this time while
I have roamed up and down the world in weary search
for you?”</p>

<p>She answered with careless badinage, and Arthur<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
moved away from them to Cinthia, who stood apart outside
the door with a cloud on her bonny face.</p>

<p>In hoarse, indistinct accents, he murmured:</p>

<p>“Miss Dawn, will you permit me the favor of a few
words with you? We can walk along this rose-alley, and
the others will follow presently.”</p>

<p>She bowed silently, and moved on by his side between
the rows of blossoming rose-trees that, neglected and
untrimmed, threw out long briery arms across the weed-grown
path, obliging Arthur now and then to stoop and
hold them aside from contact with her rustling silken
gown.</p>

<p>For a few moments they were quite silent—dangerously
silent for two who had not quite unlearned “the
sweet, sweet lesson of loving;” for in this charmed spot,
that held the echo of lovers’ vows, beneath that blue and
sunny sky, with the zephyrs wooing the flowers, were
a hundred temptations to go back to the old days and
the old love, whose summer had been so brief, whose
winter so dark and endless.</p>

<p>They both felt it subtly, painfully. Their beautiful
faces were pale with secret anguish, their lips trembled
with emotion, tears hid beneath the drooping lids of the
eyes they dared not raise to each other.</p>

<p>But Arthur knew that he must not linger in idle dalliance,
that he must break away from the spell of her
beauty, that because he was a man, and the stronger one<span class="pagenum">[166]</span>
of the two, that for her own sake his hand must break
the bonds of loving.</p>

<p>He said tremulously, though he tried to make his voice
firm:</p>

<p>“You must not be angry with me, Cinthia, if I may
call you so, for what I am going to say.”</p>

<p>She answered not a word, she only trembled like a
reed in the wind.</p>

<p>Not all her pride, nor all her scorn of his weakness,
could make her indifferent to Arthur Varian.</p>

<p>He continued, in that low, sad voice:</p>

<p>“We have put the past away forever, have we not
Cinthia?”</p>

<p>What a strange question that was. It made her heart
leap with a strangled hope. Did he wish to go back to
that past, regretting his folly, craving her pardon and
her love again?</p>

<p>She flashed him such a swift, startled glance that, misinterpreting
it, he cried out, quickly:</p>

<p>“Ah, I knew that you could never forgive me. I
could never dare to ask it. It is not for myself I wish to
plead, but for another.”</p>

<p>“Another?” she echoed, faintly.</p>

<p>“My cousin Fred loves you madly,” Arthur went on
hoarsely. “He is a noble fellow, with but few faults,
and has a most lovable nature. Oh, Cinthia, it would
make me almost happy if he could win your heart and
make you—my cousin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[167]</span></p>

<p>He paused, and Cinthia uttered one strangling gasp
of surprise and pain, and was silent.</p>

<p>But in that moment the whole bright, sunny world
seemed to go under a pall of inky blackness. The birds
seemed to cease their singing, the flowers faded and
turned to ashes, the last hope, for now she knew that
she had always cherished a faint, piteous hope, seemed
to die in her heart.</p>

<p>She would have liked to shriek aloud in her pain and
shame, like one who felt herself falling down, down,
down into a bottomless gulf.</p>

<p>Now she knew indeed that Arthur’s love had been of
little worth. It was dead, dead—or he could never plead
with her the cause of another.</p>

<p>She felt as if she must faint in the extremity of her
agony, but she made a terrible effort to rally her strength
and courage, and the next moment she heard her own
voice laughing hollowly, like a thing apart from herself.</p>

<p>“I have amused you,” Arthur cried.</p>

<p>“Yes, very much,” she replied, laughing more and
more, as if at some great joke.</p>

<p>In fact, she could not stop herself. She was on the
border of an hysterical outbreak.</p>

<p>But Arthur was deceived by her seeming levity, and
suffered a pang of outraged dignity.</p>

<p>“I see that you do not take me seriously, though I
am very much in earnest,” he exclaimed, stiffly.</p>

<p>“So am I,” she answered, trying to subdue herself, and<span class="pagenum">[168]</span>
wiping her eyes on a tiny square of lace. With another
ripple of laughter, she added, lightly: “I have often
heard of match-making mammas, but a match-making
cousin is something new, ha! ha! and I am surprised at
Fred Foster getting another man to do his courting for
him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Cinthia, you have quite misunderstood me!” he
cried, in alarm. “Fred has no thought of what I have
said to you. He is indeed capable of wooing for himself,
and I think he has already told you of his love. Do
not, I pray you, be angry at him for my blundering.
When I spoke to you I had but one thought in my mind—my
great desire to see you happy.”</p>

<p>His voice was humble, imploring, but she checked her
wild laughter with a strong effort of will, and turned on
him the fire of dark, resentful eyes.</p>

<p>“How dare you imply that I am unhappy? Can you
dream I cling to the dead past still, that I remember it
with aught but relief that I escaped you?” imperiously.</p>

<p>“Is it so indeed, Cinthia? Then I am rejoiced to hear
it, unselfishly glad that I have not spoiled your life. The
day may come when you and I, each married to another,
may yet become dear friends,” he cried, earnestly, pleadingly.</p>

<p>Cinthia felt that indeed she hated him now, but pride
rose in arms to mask every emotion.</p>

<p>She laughed again and actually held out her hand to
him, saying carelessly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[169]</span></p>

<p>“A pleasant prophecy! Let us begin our friendship
now.”</p>

<p>He took the hand and bent his head over it. She felt
a hot, burning tear fall on it as he murmured:</p>

<p>“Thank you and bless you Cinthia. We will soon get
used to the new role of friendship, and no woman ever
found truer friend than I will prove to you.”</p>

<p>Then they heard the other two coming, and stopped to
wait for them, relieved at the interruption.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A SECRET SORROW.</span></h2>

<div class="poetry-container1">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I dreamed that time, I dreamed that pride,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Had quenched at length my early flame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Nor knew till seated by thy side,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">My heart in all save hope the same.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Cinthia had made a rash promise, and she realized it;
but her pride would not permit her to retract.</p>

<p>She knew well that Arthur Varian was still too fatally
dear to her heart for her to meet him daily on mere
friendly grounds; that would only augment her love
and her despair, since neither pride nor reason had sufficed
to quench the smoldering flame.</p>

<p>Since Arthur was not conceited, and was unversed in
the complex windings of a woman’s nature, he was
mystified, if not entirely deceived, by the words in which<span class="pagenum">[170]</span>
she gave him to understand that she loved him no longer,
but was willing to let friendship take the place of passion.</p>

<p>Although he did not quite understand her manner, he
was more than glad to find that her love had been more
shallow than at first appeared and more easily conquered.
He had been in deep earnest when he told her he hoped
that the day might come when each of them, married to
another, might yet become dear friends.</p>

<p>His dearest hope now was to see her married to his
cousin, or to any man who could secure to her the happiness
that had been so fatally jeopardized by her broken
betrothal with himself.</p>

<p>As for his own marriage, at which he had hinted, his
mother was trying to bring that about with all the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">finesse</i>
of which she was capable. She surrounded herself constantly
with fair young girls, and went much into society
solely on Arthur’s account, but she could not see that she
was making any progress in her desires.</p>

<p>Arthur was equally courteous to all, but he never betrayed
any preference for any. There lingered about him
a secret sadness that in truth found no mitigation with
time. There was a subtle change in him only to be interpreted
by the poet’s lines.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I have a secret sorrow here,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">A grief I’ll never impart;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">It heaves no sigh, it sheds no tear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">But it consumes my heart.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In secret he deplored this meeting with Cinthia, that<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>
had so suddenly reopened the seared wounds of the past,
but her assumed indifference gave him a new thought.</p>

<p>Perhaps if they were to meet daily on the new terms of
friendship the old bitterness might gradually be dispelled
and better feelings result.</p>

<p>He might also in this way help his cousin to prosecute
his suit with Cinthia.</p>

<p>So Arthur fell into the net that Cinthia’s pride spread
for his feet, and it was written in the book of fate that
he and Cinthia were to meet daily for weeks, for with
the arrival of winter guests at Weir Park Hotel and
vicinity, a little season of mild gayety set in, in which
every one in the neighborhood bore part. And as for
Frederick Foster, it seemed as if he could hardly exist
away from Lodge Delight.</p>

<p>Not that Cinthia gave him any particular encouragement
to come, beyond simple courtesy; but he was vexed
at himself for former rashness, and determined to try
the effect of patient devotion in besieging her heart. Besides,
there were other men now trying to rival him, and
he must spare no effort to distance these rivals.</p>

<p>Arthur did not always accompany his cousin on his
visits; but he could not avoid meeting Cinthia often in the
social life at Weir Park, and it seemed to him that she
grew more bright and beautiful daily as the unattainable
always grows more lovely to our eyes.</p>

<p>Whether she appeared in silk and lace and nodding
plumes at some garden-party, or in yacht costume for a<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>
lake excursion, or in cycling suit on her wheel, or in
evening-dress at some gay reception, Cinthia was always
lovelier than before to his admiring eyes, and he thought,
generously:</p>

<p>“I thank Heaven that the dear girl has the means
to gratify her expensive tastes, for who knows how much
it has helped in the cure of her heart. Besides, she has
now several lovers every way as desirable as I ever was,
and even if she refuses Fred she is sure to choose one
of the others.”</p>

<p>Why was she sure to do so? Had not his mother presented
to him scores of pretty girls without touching his
heart? Why should Cinthia’s fancy be turned aside more
lightly than his own?</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">MYSTERIES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Madame Ray looked on at the little by-play with rather
puzzled eyes.</p>

<p>For once Cinthia’s pride had enabled her to keep her
own confidence. She told her friend nothing of what had
passed between her and Arthur Varian, choosing to let
her believe that indifference had triumphed over love
at last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[173]</span></p>

<p>Madame Ray simply did not believe it, but she was
mystified by the new attitude of the quondam lovers, and
she resented in secret Arthur’s reappearance on the scene.
She wished eagerly that Cinthia would lose her heart to
Fred Foster or some of her other lovers, but she did not
believe that there was the least chance of it.</p>

<p>But the more she saw of Arthur Varian the more she
was attracted by his true manliness, until her first opinion
of him, her preconceived detestation, dissolved into thin
air, and she became more and more convinced that not
simply a slavish submission to his mother’s will, but some
mysterious, impassable barrier, separated him from
Cinthia.</p>

<p>She had carried out her intention of questioning old
Uncle Rube as to the name of Mrs. Varian’s divorced
husband, but he had suddenly pretended an amazing stupidity
and loss of memory that was inconceivable, measured
by his former sprightliness. On being perniciously
pressed by the lady, he admitted that the name, “as well
as he could <em>recomember</em>, was Brown.”</p>

<p>She did not guess that an interview with Arthur Varian
had caused the loss of memory in the old servitor of the
Varian family.</p>

<p>“It was money in his pocket to forget the past when
questioned by any one,” Arthur cautioned him.</p>

<p>“Brown, Brown—that sounds rather like Dawn,” cogitated
Madame Ray; but she could make nothing further
of the old negro, and desisted, thinking that after all<span class="pagenum">[174]</span>
she was sure to blunder on the truth at last, being in the
neighborhood of the Varians.</p>

<p>Perhaps Arthur felt this also. They were bitter days
for him when he felt as if he were walking over a powder
mine that might at any moment explode and bring
ruin and disaster.</p>

<p>In his earnest way he fathomed Madame Ray’s feelings
closely enough to feel her vague suspicions, and
he was sorely tempted to confide his trouble to her
sympathetic keeping, and beg her to assist him in getting
Cinthia happily married. That fact accomplished, nothing
else mattered. The whole world was welcome to his
sad story.</p>

<p>It was pitiful, his eagerness over Cinthia’s happiness.
Madame Ray observed it and marveled, saying to herself:</p>

<p>“He put upon her the greatest insult almost that man
can offer woman, deserting her at the very altar; but he
is as eager for her happiness as if she belonged to him
by the dearest ties. I believe he would give his life freely
to save her one pang. What <em>is</em> the mystery? Is there
insanity in one family or the other? Or were some of
<em>her</em> relations hung or in prison, thus making her ineligible
for alliance with the noble Varians? I would give the
world to know the truth, for Cinthia’s sake.”</p>

<p>She and Arthur became almost unconsciously great
friends, for when the cousins came to call together at
Lodge Delight, Fred Foster always tacitly appropriated<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>
Cinthia, while the hostess was left to Arthur, who never
failed to make himself entertaining.</p>

<p>He, too, had his little curiosity over certain things—namely,
the connection between the actress and Cinthia.</p>

<p>“Are you related, you two, who are so fond of each
other?” he asked her, frankly, one day, when they had
been acquainted going on three weeks.</p>

<p>“No, we are not related at all. I suppose it looks like
it to you because we are so exceedingly fond of each
other,” she replied, with a gentle sigh.</p>

<p>“You surprise me,” he replied, in wonder. “There
is so marked a resemblance between you that I do not see
how you escaped relationship.”</p>

<p>“It must be your fancy, that is all. My eyes are blue
and Cinthia’s dark, my hair is light-brown and hers pure
gold. Still, I might have had a dark-eyed daughter, but
I lost her in her infancy, and that is one reason why I
love Cinthia so—first, because she is so near the age of
my lost daughter, and again, because she is so sweet and
good—and unhappy,” she replied, pointedly.</p>

<p>Arthur Varian winced, and replied:</p>

<p>“I insist that Cinthia resembles you closely enough to
be your own child.”</p>

<p>“Alas, I would that she were!” she cried, with sudden
emotion.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Arthur Varian was somewhat startled by Madame
Ray’s emotion. He looked at her in gentle sympathy as
she dashed the fugitive tears from her eyes.</p>

<p>She read his thoughts, and after a short silence said
gravely:</p>

<p>“You are surprised at my emotion, and you think me
a very mysterious woman. Perhaps you are even curious
over my history.”</p>

<p>“You have read my thoughts,” he answered. “But,
believe me, it is not vulgar curiosity, but the keen interest
awakened by one so charming, we would fain know
more.”</p>

<p>She acknowledged the pretty compliment by a grateful
smile, and the words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[177]</span></p>

<p>“I am tempted to gratify your wish by giving you a
brief synopsis of my life.”</p>

<p>“I should be proud to be thus honored with your confidence,”
he answered, gratefully and truthfully, for he
found her most interesting, and guessed that some sad
story lay masked behind the occasional pathos of her
smile.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘If I dared leave this smile,’ she said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent5">‘And take a moan upon my mouth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And tie a cypress round my head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">And let my tears run smooth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">It were the happier way,’ she said.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was not often that Madame Ray bestowed confidence
on any one. She was naturally a reserved woman, but
she had grown fond of Arthur, and read his friendly
curiosity over her past. She determined to gratify it,
perhaps hoping for a like confidence from him.</p>

<p>Glancing toward the open door of the drawing-room,
where they sat to see that no one was near, she began:</p>

<p>“I was born in Macon, Georgia, about thirty-nine
years ago, and was married at eighteen to Richard Ray,
a young man I had known from childhood, and who had
been my school-boy lover. We were devoted to each
other, and never had any girl better reason for devotion;
for, besides being magnificently handsome in a dark and
manly style, he was one of the noblest of men.</p>

<p>“To refer briefly to our family history, Richard was
the only son of a Georgia planter ruined by the late war,
and at the time of our marriage both his parents were<span class="pagenum">[178]</span>
dead, while my father and sisters had died of fever
in my childhood, leaving mother and I alone in the world
almost save for her rich aunt who lived at Lodge Delight,
and took scant notice of our existence.</p>

<p>“My mother had but a small property, and Richard
was not rich; but at his business—a real estate agency—he
earned a fair competency, and when we were married,
we three, mamma, Richard and I, lived together very
happily until—alas!” she bowed her head and wept bitterly.</p>

<p>“Do not continue if it pains you so,” Arthur cried,
with keen sympathy; but she checked a rising sob, and
continued:</p>

<p>“I have been most bitterly bereaved, for when only
eight months a bride, my dear mother was taken from
me by an attack of heart failure. Her death was very
sudden, and without premonition. She was gathering
some flowers to take to the cemetery to place on the
graves of her husband and children, when she suddenly
fell forward, and expired painlessly among the roses.</p>

<p>“It was a cruel blow, but I bore it bravely, because
I knew that she was reunited to her dear ones gone before,
and I had my dear Richard left to comfort me, besides
the hope of a future blessing.”</p>

<p>Again that heavy sigh from the depths of a burdened
heart, whose agony had been almost unendurable. Then
she took up the thread of her story again, murmuring:</p>

<p>“I was so young; and I loved my husband so dearly,
and he made me so blissfully happy, that I was getting
over my mother’s loss just a little, when two months later—oh,
Heaven, only two months later—God took away my
Richard!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[179]</span></p>

<p>Again her voice broke, and she remained sad and silent
until she could regain it, then went on:</p>

<p>“On a trip away from home, in the interest of some
intending land buyers, he was killed instantly in a railroad
wreck. Oh, my God! how did I live through that sorrow?
Only, by Thine infinite grace and love, and the
hope of that which was coming to me soon to fill the
void of my two sudden and awful bereavements. I almost
went mad at first, and I prayed for death to remove me
from the life that was now only misery.</p>

<p>“But kind friends and neighbors took charge of me.
I was placed in the care of a noble physician and skillful
nurse. The days dragged on in illness, wretchedness,
and rebellion until I had been widowed six weeks, then
God sent me a child to love—a little dark-eyed daughter.</p>

<p>“At first I was disappointed with my fate, I had so
longed for a boy to bear Richard’s name and to grow up
in his image. But kind friends soothed me, and I grew
to dote on my lovely babe. But nothing was to be left
me to love, it seemed, for when baby, as I called her, not
having chosen a name yet, was only a month old, I woke
up one night, missing the little darling from my arms,
and crying out in alarm.</p>

<p>“Alas! she too was gone, and so was the nurse who
slept on a cot in my room. She had stolen baby, for
what purpose I can not guess, and gone away, and so
carefully had she covered her flight, that after spending
every dollar of my little competency in the vain effort
to trace her, not a single clew was gained.”</p>

<p>With a shaking voice she added:</p>

<p>“I can not tell you why God made me live after all
my tribulations. I longed for death, but it did not come,
and I dared not hurl myself out of existence, having been<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>
raised by a Christian mother. So I lived, though weary
of life, and in the struggle for existence I became an
actress, having always possessed talents for the stage, and
finding in its arduous work relief from the pangs of
memory.</p>

<p>“This is, in brief, my story, and it will show you in
part why Cinthia Dawn is so dear to me. Although her
beauty and sweetness are most attractive, still it is not
those alone that draw her to my heart. It is because of
her orphanage and sorrow, for Everard Dawn, from
some cause, does not give her a real fatherly love, and
she is lonely at heart beyond expression.”</p>

<p>“Poor, poor Cinthia!” he breathed, with deep emotion.</p>

<p>She dried her tearful eyes, and continued, with a
searching glance at his perturbed face:</p>

<p>“Perhaps you would like to hear under what circumstances
I first met Cinthia?”</p>

<p>He replied very readily:</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“It seemed like chance at first, but ever since I have
thought that Providence itself sent me to the poor girl’s
aid in that hour. It was in Washington, on the morning
of your interrupted marriage, when she was waiting for
<a id="Ref_180" href="#BRef_180">her</a> father to come and take her home. I had been a
guest of the hotel the night before, and on removing to
one nearer the theater, I found I had left two handsome
rings. I returned for them, and met Cinthia just leaving
her room to go upon the street, a reckless, desperate girl,
maddened by misery and humiliation, her head filled with
insane ideas of suicide, of going on the stage, of anything
to escape from herself and her despair. I drew her
back, my heart full of love and pity, and in an hour we
changed from strangers to loving friends. I put new<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>
hope in her heart, or at least courage to bear the ills she
could not cure, so that when her father came for her she
went with him readily to the new future he had planned
by the aid of a little fortune that had suddenly fallen
to her from some distant relative.”</p>

<p>“You saved her from herself and from the keenest
pangs of the sorrow I had unwittingly brought upon her
by my enforced renunciation of our betrothal. God forever
bless you, noble woman!” cried Arthur, crushing
her hand in his in the exuberance of his gratitude, and
adding, warmly: “You wondered why you could not
die when bereaved of all that made life worth living; but
do you not see that Heaven spared you to be an angel of
mercy to this young girl?”</p>

<p>He was tempted to confide his own story to her ears,
that she might not blame him so bitterly for Cinthia’s
grief, but prudence intervened, whispering that it were
wiser to keep the cruel secret.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“A COLD, GRAY LIFE.”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Arthur Varian and his mother were the closest and
dearest friends, and since his elopement, that had ended
so unhappily, he had never kept a secret from her, believing
that she was his best adviser.</p>

<p>So he had written to her frankly of all that had happened
since he came to Florida.</p>

<p>He knew how sorry she would be that he had chanced
upon Cinthia Dawn again, but he knew also that the sorrow<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
would be offset by the knowledge that the young girl
had overcome her unhappy love, and would in all probability
be won by Frederick Foster.</p>

<p>He wrote of their pledge of friendship, their frequent
meetings, her apparent indifference to himself, and her
preference for Fred’s society.</p>

<p>Although the proud mother was pleased to know all
these things, yet she railed in secret at Cinthia’s indifference.</p>

<p>“Fickle and unstable, like her father! Who could expect
anything else of such a parentage?” she thought,
bitterly, the somber dark eyes flashing with passion.</p>

<p>On this dreary December day, at Idlewild, she was
shut into her luxurious <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boudoir</i>, away from the rain and
sleet of a most inclement day, cradled in warmth and
luxury, the air sweet with flowers, and melodious with the
songs of a large cage of canaries. A morning-robe of
purple brocade, bordered with rich fur, wrapped the
queenly form from the slightest breath of cold.</p>

<p>But with all her luxury and grandeur she was not
happy, this proud woman, who turned her eyes from the
beautiful room to gaze through the richly curtained windows
at the dreary day, as perhaps more in consonance
with her gray mood.</p>

<p>Certainly there was much in the past to darken her
life with an ineffaceable shadow, and nothing in the
future to throw any light on the present.</p>

<p>Once her life had been radiantly happy in the sunlight
of wedded love, but a terrible trial had come upon her
which ended in divorce and a desolated home.</p>

<p>The passionate pride of a strong nature had helped her
to bear it before the eyes of the world. What she suffered
in secret only Heaven knew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[183]</span></p>

<p>In her pride she would have perished rather than unmask
her secret suffering.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She tapped with restless fingers on the windowpane,
muttering:</p>

<p>“What a dismal, dreary day! I wish I had gone to
Florida with Arthur and Fred. There all is sunshine and
beauty, while here in Virginia the rain drips down the
pane like tears, the winds howl like a banshee, and the
leafless vines tap against the walls like ghostly fingers. I
hate it all, I hate my life that is gray and cold like the
day.”</p>

<p>A sudden thought came to her like an inspiration:</p>

<p>“I will join Arthur at Weir Lake. True, that girl is
there; but what of that? Her father is in California,
they say, so he will not be there to trouble my peace.
Why should he trouble it anyway? He is nothing to me,
less than nothing. I hate him. I suppose that woman
who was with them abroad, that beautiful, blue-eyed
actress, means to marry him in the end. That is why
she clings so close to the daughter. Time was when
he cared nothing for these vivacious blondes, and adored
dark eyes as if he saw heaven reflected in them. That is
all past now. He knows the devil that lurks in a woman
wronged. Yes—yes, I will join Arthur. I ought to see
about the rebuilding of the old home myself.”</p>

<p>She strained her eyes through the murky rain toward<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
the gate at a man who was striding along under an umbrella
with a free, swinging gait too fatally familiar to
her memory.</p>

<p>She pressed her hand to her throbbing heart.</p>

<p>“It is <em>he</em>! He has come back to see that old woman,
his sister! How the old feelings stir in me at sight
of him again. I wonder if—if—there was the least
truth in his words that I had wronged him. His anger
was most bitter and unforgiving. Yes—yes, I will leave
here to-morrow. I can not breathe the same air with
him!”</p>

<p>It was indeed Everard Dawn passing the gates of Idlewild
without a glance at the windows where those anguished
dark eyes watched him so eagerly between the
blur of rain and mist.</p>

<p>He was coming, as before, in storm and gloom, to his
sister’s home. An impulse of tenderness had moved him
to turn aside on his way to his daughter, to visit the
lonely old woman.</p>

<p>“It is well you came, for she is ill, and a week ago I
hardly thought she would live till your return,” grumbled
Rachel Dane, as she admitted him into the narrow hall.</p>

<p>“You should have telegraphed me,” he answered.</p>

<p>“She would not allow it. She said no one cared
whether an old woman like her lived or died.”</p>

<p>“She is mistaken. I have neglected her in my selfishness,
but I love her dearly,” he said, huskily, adding:
“And as for you, Rachel Dane, the sight of you stirs up
unpleasant memories, but I hope I see you well?”</p>

<p>“Well and hearty, sir, thanks to you for saving my
life that night, and to your sister for giving me a home
afterward. But I have tried to repay it by faithful service,”<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
she added, as she ushered him into the lonely sitting-room,
and stirred the fire into a brighter blaze.</p>

<p>“I thank you for that. She must have had a lonely
life since I took my daughter away,” he replied throwing
himself in a chair, and stretching his feet to the grateful
warmth.</p>

<p>“My daughter! My daughter!” thought Rachel Dane,
grimly. “How he would hate me if he knew the truth!
And I should never dare to tell him! No, no; I don’t
care to be bundled out-of-doors in my old age, when I
have wound myself so closely around old Mrs. Flint that
she is likely to leave me her property when she dies.”</p>

<p>She bustled about, watching him narrowly, thinking
what a handsome man he was still, in spite of his probable
fifty years.</p>

<p>Then she inquired if he would not have luncheon before
he went up to the sick-room.</p>

<p>“No, I had a substantial breakfast on the train, and
would like to see my sister as soon as possible,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Oh, then you may come upstairs at once. The sight
of you will be good for her old eyes.”</p>

<p>He followed her up to the sick-room, that Rachel Dane
had made as cheerful and bright as possible, and there
lay poor Mrs. Flint among her pillows, wan and aged in
the three years that had elapsed since last they met, but
with a light of joy in her dim eyes as they <a id="Ref_185" href="#BRef_185">rested</a> again
on his face.</p>

<p>“My dear sister!”</p>

<p>And he stooped and kissed her most affectionately.</p>

<p>“How long you have been away—you and Cinthy!—and
I have missed her so, dear girl, though maybe I
wasn’t none too good to her when she was here, but I<span class="pagenum">[186]</span>
thought she ought to be brought up strict,” she murmured,
plaintively.</p>

<p>“It was my fault. I told you to do it,” he answered,
with a sigh; and his eyes wandered around the room,
noting vases of hot-house flowers and plates of fruit,
purple grapes, contrasted with the delicate green of malagas,
golden oranges, and crimson-cheeked apples.</p>

<p>“You have kind neighbors,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; all the church people come to see me, and
the preacher—though Rachel there doesn’t care about
him,” reproachfully. “Mrs. Bowles, the housekeeper at
Idlewild, comes often, too. She brought me the fruit
and flowers from up there. Her mistress sent them—that
grand Mrs. Varian, you know. I think it was kind in her
after the way you treated her son.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” and he paled to the lips under his rich brown
beard. “Well, and so they are there still?”</p>

<p>“She is. Arthur’s gone off somewhere, Mrs. Bowles
said. I don’t know where.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dawn had no idea either. His daughter had not
written him of her meeting with Arthur.</p>

<p>Presently he said, with a smile:</p>

<p>“Rebecca, I have a bright idea. Hurry up and get
strong enough to travel, and I’ll take you and Rachel
South with me on a visit to Cinthia, if you would like it.”</p>

<p>“Like it! Oh,” she cried, with sudden, pleasurable excitement,
“indeed I should, Everard. It will take the
rheumatism out of my old bones, the blessed sunshine of
the warm South.”</p>

<p>“Yes; all you need is a change. You are not so much
sick as just pining,” commented Rachel Dane.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">PUPPETS OF FATE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>No ordinary circumstance would have availed to keep
Mrs. Varian at Idlewild after she had discovered Everard
Dawn’s return to the neighborhood, but on the same day
of her sudden determination to leave, fate intervened to
prevent her immediate flight.</p>

<p>Her clever, skillful maid, the faithful attendant of
many years, without whom Mrs. Varian was as helpless
as a child, was taken ill with a serious cold and confined
to her bed for several days.</p>

<p>Her mistress was in despair, but even her imperious
will was powerless now against the inroads of illness.
She had to abide the woman’s recovery with patience,
however much she chafed in secret against the unwelcome
delay.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bowles cheerfully took on herself the duties of
lady’s-maid in addition to her housekeeping tasks, and
called in a sick-nurse from the neighborhood to attend
to the invalid. In about three days she began to convalesce,
though it was five before she was able to assist
Mrs. Bowles with the necessary packing for the southward
fight.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Mrs. Flint was also improving fast,
the pleasing prospect of the journey southward having
exerted on her mind a more beneficial effect than all
Doctor Savoy’s pills and potions.</p>

<p>She dwelt with keen delight on the thought of seeing
her niece again, and disconcerted her brother by wondering<span class="pagenum">[188]</span>
if Cinthia had recovered from her disappointment
at losing Arthur Varian.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, yes; she was over all that long ago,” he replied,
hastily, anxious to dismiss the subject.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Flint continued, feelingly:</p>

<p>“Poor Cinthy! it was hard on her to have to give
him up, he was such a dear young man. And such a
grand match, too, for a poor girl like her! Oh, I never
can forget the night she came home from Idlewild in the
grand carriage with Arthur, in his mother’s grand dress
and cloak, and told me she was engaged to him. It was
all so sudden, it nearly took my breath away. And what
a beauty she looked! and how happy she was! Oh, my!
<em>Poor</em> Cinthy!”</p>

<p>She sighed deeply, but Everard Dawn made no comment,
only looked out of the window at the cold winter
sunshine on the leaf-strewn garden-walks, where a light
snow of last night’s falling was fast melting away.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flint continued, retrospectively:</p>

<p>“She told me how sweet and kind Mrs. Varian was
to her that night—not proud and haughty as she had
imagined she would be. She could see plainly that she
did not mind it a bit for Arthur to fall in love with her,
though she was a poor girl. And how bad that kind lady
must have felt when Arthur told her you would not let
him have your daughter.”</p>

<p>“It is all past and done now, Rebecca, and no use
discussing it,” her brother said, restlessly.</p>

<p>“I know—but I have just been wondering whether
you had changed your mind yet, seeing as they are both
single, and maybe anxious to make it up with each other.”</p>

<p>“I have not changed my mind,” he answered, watching<span class="pagenum">[189]</span>
the loosened icicles drop crackling from the eaves, and
wishing she would change the subject.</p>

<p>She went on sadly:</p>

<p>“I would give anything to see poor Cinthy real happy
again like she was that night. I used to be too strict
with the child, I know, and I’ve repented it now. How
happy she might have been if she’d had such a mother as
Mrs. Varian, who would have spoiled and petted her as
mothers do, and made her life so bright. I tell you, Everard,
she is a good woman in spite of her pride. Our
minister says she is so good to the poor, and, besides, she
has given a thousand dollars to repair the church. He
told me he did not believe she was so proud and exclusive
as some people thought. He had called on her once,
and she was very kind and sweet in a way, but there was
something rather sad in her manner, or cynical, maybe,
as if she had some trouble and was not resigned to it.”</p>

<p>Would she never get done talking on this (to her) most
interesting subject?</p>

<p>Everard Dawn yawned impatiently, and answered
thoughtlessly:</p>

<p>“Yes, she was always like that, generous to a fault,
noble at heart, charming, but jealous, passionate, unreasonable.”</p>

<p>“Why, Everard, did you know her some time?” she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I know a nun who did,” he answered curtly, getting
up from his seat, and adding: “Rebecca, it is about sunset,
and I will take a walk and a smoke before our early
tea.”</p>

<p>Donning great-coat and hat, he hurried out-of-doors,
thinking:</p>

<p>“If I had not got away from her chatter of Pauline<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>
Varian, I should have screamed out aloud like a nervous
woman, I verily believe.”</p>

<p>He walked away in the dying glow of the rosy sunset
toward the little town, passing Idlewild, as he did daily,
and watched by eyes of which he little recked, for he was
too proud to glance toward her windows.</p>

<p>Every day, with an angry pain, she had seen him pass
and she thanked fate there would be but one day more
of it, for the maid was well again now, though why she
should have watched him when she need not, no man
could have told, since the sex is rather obtuse on feminine
caprices.</p>

<p>Why need she follow him with such straining gaze, she,
the proud, wealthy Mrs. Varian, admired of men, envied
of women, no less for her charms than her gifts of fortune?
She had everything life could give but happiness.
He—and she knew it—was but a poor lawyer, too careless
of fortune to woo her successfully, too weary of life to
find pleasure in it; not quite so blue-blooded as the
Varians, either, yet not a man to look down on, for nature
at least had been lavish of brains and beauty and stubborn
pride, not to mention an unenviable capacity for
suffering stolidly borne.</p>

<p>In her heart she believed him weak and unstable and
scorned him accordingly; but as for him, he understood
her better than she did herself, yet never relaxed his resentment
over a cruel wrong, never contemplated forgiveness,
even if she should pray for it.</p>

<p>Watching her carriage yesterday, as it dashed past
the steps where he had stood, he had recalled with grim
pain some fitting words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[191]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You walk the sunny side of fate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The wise world smiles and calls you great,</div>

    <div class="verse indent1">Have loved you better than you knew.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was no more pleasant for him than for her that they
should meet again, and he also was glad that to-morrow
would be the last day of it. His sister would be able
to travel then, and they would start for Florida.</p>

<p>Since the maid’s sickness Mrs. Bowles had not come to
see Mrs. Flint any more. The occupants of the grand
mansion and the lofty cottage did not know they had each
planned for a flitting the same day, by the same train,
and to the same destination.</p>

<p>They could not have believed that the grim fates would
have so mocked them, but yet, when Mrs. Varian and her
maid swept to their seats in the train that Thursday,
Everard Dawn and his party had already arrived, and
he had arranged the still weak invalid very comfortably
with the load of shawls and cushions carried by Rachel
Dane.</p>

<p>Mrs. Varian, ignoring the passengers with her usual
queenly air, sunk to her seat in blissful unconsciousness,
and buried herself in her novel. Not for two hours did
she discover the identity of her traveling companions, because
at first she did not vouchsafe them even one curious
glance.</p>

<p>Not so Everard Dawn, who had started in surprise and
perturbation at her first entrance.</p>

<p>“The fates have made us traveling companions—not<span class="pagenum">[192]</span>
for the first time, but I pray Heaven for the last!” was
his grim thought.</p>

<p>He was sitting some seats ahead, and he resolutely
turned his back to her, hoping not to disturb her peace by
the disclosure of her identity, and thinking it hardly possible
they should be fellow-travelers long. She was probably
going to Richmond or Washington.</p>

<p>There were but few passengers, and they were very
quiet as the train rushed on through the dull gray afternoon.
Mrs. Flint, weary from the getting ready for the
journey, dozed fitfully among her cushions, and Rachel
Dane glued her face to the window-pane, and watched
the flying landscape. As for Everard Dawn, he looked
neither to the right nor left, but stared straight before
him in a brown study. Mrs. Varian’s maid amused herself
by studying the passengers, and discovered that some
of them belonged to the town they had just left, though
she did not suppose her haughty mistress would take any
interest in that fact.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“THE WEIGHT OF CRUEL YEARS PILED INTO ONE LONG AGONY.”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Mrs. Varian read on and on until her eyes grew weary,
then closing them, she leaned back with a tired sigh, and
fell to musing.</p>

<p>Perhaps the musings were not pleasant, for presently
she sighed deeply again, and raising her head began to
look around her in a listless way at the passengers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[193]</span></p>

<p>She gave a violent start, and stared fixedly at the handsome
head and broad shoulders a few seats ahead.</p>

<p>Could it be? Or was she dreaming? Surely those outlines
were too familiar for her to be mistaken.</p>

<p>It was <em>he</em>! She saw him lean forward to answer the
women in the next seat. The outline of his handsome
profile was clear for a moment.</p>

<p>She fell back almost stunned, secretly railing at her ill
fortune.</p>

<p>Janetta, the maid, leaned forward from the back seat.</p>

<p>“Do you wish anything, madame? You seem ill.”</p>

<p>She whispered back:</p>

<p>“Who are those people in front of us there?”</p>

<p>“Some people from your own town, madame; a Mrs.
Flint, her brother, and her servant. The lady has been
sick, and I heard the conductor telling some one back
there that they were going South for her health.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” and Mrs. Varian shut her eyes and relapsed
into pallor and silence again.</p>

<p>Janetta, good, faithful soul, watched her uneasily, feeling
she was not well.</p>

<p>She was inwardly ill indeed—raging at the trick fate
had played on her this day.</p>

<p>“To endure this thirty-six hours—the sight of him
whenever I open my eyes—it is impossible!” she said to
herself, in a sort of blank terror.</p>

<p>Janetta touched her gently, whispering:</p>

<p>“You are very pale—I hope not ill.”</p>

<p>She could fancy that she was ghastly to evoke this
anxiety, so she answered:</p>

<p>“I do not feel quite my usual self. I am thinking of not
going on to-night any further than Charlottesville, and resuming
our journey to-morrow, if I am better.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[194]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps that is the better plan,” the maid returned,
respectfully, though secretly rather disappointed at delaying
the journey.</p>

<p>But she was used to her mistress and her capricious
notions. She had simply to obey.</p>

<p>So when they reached the university town a little further
on, the mistress and maid left the train, to the great
relief of Everard Dawn, who thought:</p>

<p>“I was right. She is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> for Washington. She
will board the Northern train at this point. But how
lonely it seemed, just the two women traveling together.
I remember she used to be one of those dependent women,
always preferring a man’s escort. Arthur ought to be
with her now, poor Paulina!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Flint exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Was not that Mrs. Varian leaving the train?”</p>

<p>“I believe so,” he replied, carelessly; and then the brief
wait at the station being over, the train rushed on into
the deep gloom of twilight.</p>

<p>It was scarcely a mile further on that, lying back with
shut eyes and confused thoughts that mostly centered
around the lonely figure of the woman just gone, he was
roused by a terrible roar, a jumble of horrible sound,
movement, and stifled shrieks of fear and pain, then consciousness
gave way, and he lay still and death-like under
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i> of a dreadful railway wreck—a collision caused
by the misplacing of a switch.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mrs. Varian revived out in the cold evening air, and
she congratulated herself on her lucky escape, as she and
Janetta sought the nearest hotel.</p>

<p>They had supper, and went to their rooms, a luxurious
connecting suite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[195]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Varian was nervous and hysterically gay, laughing
to herself at the clever <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup</i> by which she had outwitted
fate.</p>

<p>“I wonder if he saw me—if he guessed why I left
the train—but perhaps he was glad of it,” she thought.</p>

<p>She walked restlessly up and down the room, chafing
under a weight that seemed to rest like a pall on her spirits—a
weight of prescient gloom.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Varian, you are nervous. You ought to take
some drops and retire, or you will not be fit to resume
your journey in the morning,” the maid remonstrated,
when she had watched her restless movements some time
in silence.</p>

<p>“You are right Janetta, and I will take your advice. I
should like to sleep, for my thoughts are not pleasant to-night,”
the lady returned, docilely.</p>

<p>But sleep would not come to the heavy lids, for all she
tried to deceive Janetta by lying as still as a mouse, with
her cheek in the hollow of her little hand.</p>

<p>Strange tears crept under the black-fringed lashes and
dampened the pillow. The maid caught a stifled sob.</p>

<p>“Ah, madame, it is bad dreams you’re having!” she
murmured, stroking the dark head gently.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, bad dreams, Janetta.”</p>

<p>“And no wonder, with the noise and confusion going
on down-stairs, tramping like horses the last ten minutes.
I can’t imagine what all the racket means, and if you don’t
object, madame, I’ll go down and ask the clerk to have the
noise stopped, so you may sleep better.”</p>

<p>“You may go.”</p>

<p>When Janetta was gone, she sat up in bed, throwing
her jeweled hands wildly about crying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[196]</span></p>

<p>“How I deceived that kind, faithful creature! I have
not slept a moment. I have been too wretched. There
is too great a weight on my heart—the whole weight of
cruel years piled into one wild agony to-night! Oh, death
were better than this pain!”</p>

<p>Janetta was gone fully fifteen minutes before she returned,
pale, and tearfully excited, wringing her hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, madame, you are still awake! Then thank God
for the lucky inspiration that came to you at Charlottesville
to leave the train! It was surely Heaven that
prompted you, for else we might now both be dead!”</p>

<p>“Janetta!” wildly.</p>

<p>“Oh, madame, the train was wrecked scarcely a mile
further on, and people were killed—some of them—others
were wounded, and may die! They are bringing them
back here—that was the noise we heard—the tramping of
feet that woke you. Oh, I have shocked you, breaking this
so abruptly; but I did not think, I was so excited. Pardon
me, dear lady. Of course there were none of your
friends, as all were strangers to us.”</p>

<p>“All strangers!” gasped Mrs. Varian in a hollow voice,
with terror in her eyes, as she clung to Janetta’s soothing
hands.</p>

<p>The excited maid ran on breathlessly:</p>

<p>“Those people you noticed in front of us, madame—oh,
it was dreadful! The sick woman escaped unhurt,
but the servant was badly injured, and the man—Mr.
Dawn they say his name is—was killed outright.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">CINTHIA’S BETROTHAL.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Arthur Varian was roused at midnight by the reception
of a startling telegram from his mother:</p>

<p>“Everard Dawn fatally injured in a railway accident
here. Come at once, and bring Cinthia.”</p>

<p>He staggered to a chair, groaning aloud!</p>

<p>“So this is the sorrowful end!”</p>

<p>Conquering an onrushing flood of painful emotion,
he sought Frederick Foster, and imparted the sad news.</p>

<p>“Heavens, how shocking! And I had only a few hours
ago written to ask him for his daughter’s hand!” exclaimed
the young man.</p>

<p>“Then Cinthia has accepted you!” Arthur cried, with
emotion.</p>

<p>“Yes, only yesterday, and I intended to tell you to-morrow.
Can you wish me joy, old fellow?” inquired
Fred Foster, anxiously, for his cousin had made him
acquainted with all his sad past story, and he felt the
keenest sympathy with his unhappiness.</p>

<p>Arthur held out a cordial hand.</p>

<p>“It is good news to me—under the circumstances.
May you both be very happy!” he exclaimed, generously.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Arthur. I will do my part toward it,”
returned the young man, in a hopeful tone, adding: “We
had better go at once to Lodge Delight for Cinthia. I
will go with you to Virginia, and no doubt Madame Ray
will give us the comfort of her company.”</p>

<p>“I shall beg her to do so,” said Arthur. “I am sure
she will not refuse, for my mother would be perhaps but<span class="pagenum">[198]</span>
a poor consoler in the hour of grief. Indeed, I am puzzled
to know how she and Mr. Dawn ever happened to
be together at Charlottesville, for they have always
avoided each other. But the mystery can not be solved
until we reach her side.”</p>

<p>Making the most hasty preparations possible for leaving,
they set out for Lodge Delight, having first sent a
telegram to Mrs. Varian at Charlottesville, assuring her
that they would start at once.</p>

<p>So expeditious were their movements, that before
daylight the four were on the train speeding to Virginia,
Madame Ray having gladly acceded to their request for
her company.</p>

<p>“Of course I would not permit Cinthia to go alone to so
sad a scene as her father’s death-bed, poor dear!” she
said, with warm sympathy.</p>

<p>Cinthia was shocked and grieved at the news of Everard
Dawn’s accident and impending death, but her grief
lacked the depth of a filial bereavement. Owing to her
strong resentment at his own coldness, the girl had never
felt the sentiment of love for him. If Madame Ray had
died she would have been inconsolable, but in the case of
her father she felt quite differently.</p>

<p>She was shocked and pained, but she would have felt
almost as deeply over any well-known friend who had
met with such an accident. His death would not mean
any serious affliction to her. Indeed, when the first
shock was over, she remembered that perhaps now she
would never have to leave dear Madame Ray for another
home. True, in a moment of madness and resentment
at Arthur’s coldness, she had rashly consented to marry
his cousin, but she was not at all certain that she would
keep her promise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[199]</span></p>

<p>She had told him frankly that she admired and esteemed
him, but had no love to give. If he was willing to
wait, to give her time to cultivate a warmer feeling, she
would try her best to learn, and on these terms he based
their betrothal. To Cinthia herself it seemed as if she
must surely grow fond of him in time, he was so handsome,
so splendid, so devoted. She argued to herself
that in time her love for Arthur must surely be overcome
by her contempt for his weakness and cowardice that
had brought sorrow into both their lives.</p>

<p>Yet, as she watched his pale and sorrowful face while
the train sped on its way, she felt a rush of painful tenderness
flooding her heart, while she wondered why he
was taking so much to heart the trouble that had fallen
on herself. Everard Dawn was nothing to him—nothing
except a man he had cause to dislike, because he had prevented
his marriage to his daughter—yet his pallor, his
sadness, his preoccupation were effects that might have
been produced by the death of a near relative.</p>

<p>Cinthia, drooping in her seat, with a thick veil drawn
over her pallid face, could not keep her eyes from her
old lover, could not repress the rush of tenderness that
made her heart ache.</p>

<p>She would have liked—she, the promised bride of Frederick
Foster—to have thrown her arms about Arthur
Varian’s neck, pressed her pale cheek to his, and whispered
in the passion of her womanly love:</p>

<p>“Why are you so pale, so sad, my best beloved? Is
it for me? Has Frederick told you that I have promised
to marry him, and are you grieved? Perhaps the
old love is not dead yet in your heart, perhaps it cries
for me in the dead of night as my heart for you. Oh,<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
is it too late to go back, to thrust aside everything but the
imperious demands of our love, and be happy yet?”</p>

<p>A sudden wild thought yet came to her and made her
heart leap:</p>

<p>“Only let me find my father yet alive, and he shall
explain the mystery of his opposition to my marriage with
Arthur. She, too, is there, Arthur’s mother, who for the
sake of her hatred of my father and mother was willing
to wreck our happiness forever. Who knows but that
when both are dead, both my mother and father, her cruel
revenge may be satiated so that she may be willing to let
love have its way.”</p>

<p>It would have startled Frederick Foster, who hovered
near her with eager attentions, to find how little part
he had in her thoughts and dreams, for a faint trembling
hope had come to her heart that perhaps the death of her
father might have some effect on her relations with
Arthur, might possibly restore them to happiness.</p>

<p>Arthur, meanwhile, knowing the futility of all hope in
Cinthia’s direction, gave himself up to unrestrained
melancholy, in which blended considerable curiosity as
to how it happened that his mother and Mr. Dawn had
been together at Charlottesville.</p>

<p>Everard Dawn, who had an aversion to letter-writing,
corresponded but infrequently with his daughter, hence
had left her in ignorance of the date of his return from
California.</p>

<p>Mrs. Varian, on the other hand, had not apprised her
son of her suddenly decided upon journey to Florida.</p>

<p>So he could only nurse his wonder and melancholy
together while looking back in a painful retrospection
over the tangled web of what had been and what might
have been, those “saddest of all sad words.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[201]</span></p>

<p>There was a silent prayer in his heart, too, that Everard
Dawn might survive till he reached his bedside, so
that some last words might be said between them, some
news be told, and perhaps some death-bed revelations
be made to Cinthia.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">AN OBSTINATE WOMAN.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Janetta, the indiscreet maid, would never forget the
night when she blurted out the news of the railway wreck
to her ailing mistress and sent her into that long, deathly
swoon.</p>

<p>Mrs. Varian was not in the habit of fainting, and it
gave Janetta a terrible scare, especially when the usual
simple remedies failed to revive the unconscious lady.</p>

<p>Pale as a marble figure, her pallor heightened by the
loosened tresses of raven hair and the inky lashes lying
heavily against her cheek, she lay among the pillows, and
though Janetta tried frantically first one thing and then
another, no breath stirred the pulseless bosom of her
mistress.</p>

<p>She ran down-stairs for a doctor, but every medico in
the neighborhood had been summoned to the relief of
the victims of the wreck. She could get no assistance for
an hour, except that of terrified women.</p>

<p>Among them they succeeded in rousing her momentarily
to a consciousness of the situation; but almost as
soon as her dark eyes opened, she closed them again,
murmuring mournfully:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[202]</span></p>

<p>“Let me die.”</p>

<p>And the remembrance of her trouble sent her immediately
off into another spell almost as long as the
first one.</p>

<p>The frightened and sympathetic women helped
Janetta with all their skill and knowledge, until in about
half an hour they saw Mrs. Varian’s breast heave faintly
and her eyelids flutter.</p>

<p>“She’s coming to again, thank the Lord!” sobbed
Janetta. “Now one of you women step in the next
room and ask that doctor in there trying to bring a dead
man to life to come in here and help us, and if he won’t
come, to send me word how to stop her from going off
again as soon as she opens her eyes and remembers.”</p>

<p>The house-maid went, and the housekeeper said:</p>

<p>“The man looked dead to me, but that doctor thought
it might be temporary unconsciousness, and won’t leave
off trying to save him till he’s sure. But, la! his leg was
broke, and there’s a cut on the head—concussion of the
brain, maybe, so the doctor said. It’s a pity for the
poor man. He was a beauty of a fellow.”</p>

<p>“Wonder who he was?” observed another, while Mrs.
Varian’s breathing grew more pronounced, and her dark
eyes opened eagerly, as the housekeeper replied:</p>

<p>“His sister was with him—an old lady that didn’t get
hurt at all, though her servant did. She said his name
was Dawn.”</p>

<p>There was a faint, strangled gasp from the bed, and
at that moment the physician entered the room.</p>

<p>“Oh, doctor, that poor man! did he ever come to?”
eagerly inquired one of the women.</p>

<p>He answered in his quiet, professional tone:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[203]</span></p>

<p>“Yes; he recovered consciousness ten minutes ago;
but I almost fear I had as well have let him go without
disturbing his peace. He is more than likely fatally injured.”</p>

<p>Then he turned his attention to the patient, almost
starting in alarm at the preternaturally solemn look of the
great, wide open dark eyes.</p>

<p>But if he had but known it, his first words had been
more potent than medicine in aiding her recovery.</p>

<p>“You have received a great shock, and I must immediately
quiet your nerves,” he said, as his cool, steady
fingers touched her pulse.</p>

<p>“Bend lower. I must speak to you,” she murmured,
faintly.</p>

<p>He stooped down, and she whispered:</p>

<p>“Send away all but my maid.”</p>

<p>He looked around, and repeated:</p>

<p>“It is better for all these kind friends to withdraw
now, as my patient will need absolute quiet. Her maid,
of course, will remain.”</p>

<p>They all stole away very quietly, and he began to prepare
a soothing potion for his strangely beautiful patient.</p>

<p>He was startled when she murmured:</p>

<p>“Doctor, you may give me something to strengthen
me, but I will not take an opiate.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear lady—” he began, only to be interrupted
by a feeble but resolute voice:</p>

<p>“No buts, my dear doctor, for my maid here can tell
you that no one ever disputes my will. I must be
strengthened, I tell you, for in a few minutes I shall go
into the next room to visit your fatally injured patient.<span class="pagenum">[204]</span>
He is an old—friend—of mine, and I shall get you to
send a telegram for me summoning his relations to his
death-bed.”</p>

<p>“His sister is here,” he replied, pressing to her lips the
strengthening draught she demanded.</p>

<p>She swallowed it, sighed and replied:</p>

<p>“There are others, sir—a daughter for one, and—but,
Janetta, bring pencil and paper, and copy what I
dictate.”</p>

<p>With wonderful strength and self-command for one
recovering from such a seizure, she dictated the message
that Arthur received the same night.</p>

<p>“Doctor, can you have this sent at once?” she inquired.</p>

<p>He replied dubiously:</p>

<p>“I will do so as soon as possible, but the telegraph line
is very busy. There are seven victims.”</p>

<p>“Poor souls!—this must go at once at any cost. Do
you hear, doctor? Send it at once if it costs a little fortune!
They are so far away, his friends—and what if
they come—too late!” her proud voice breaking.</p>

<p>“I will do my best—and as for you, madame, I advise
you to rest quietly in your bed all night, or I will not
answer for the consequences to your outraged nerves.”</p>

<p>“I tell you, sir, I will get up and go to that dying man
at whatever cost to myself.”</p>

<p>“What an imperious woman!” he thought, and answered
aloud:</p>

<p>“At least lie here until I send off the telegram and
bring you news of my patient.”</p>

<p>“Tell me first, is there any immediate prospect of his
death?” shudderingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[205]</span></p>

<p>“None that I could see. There is a fracture of the
left leg and a cut on his head. Unless there are internal
injuries, he might stand a chance, a bare chance, for recovery,
but that long syncope was so alarming that I
have scarcely any hope of saving him.”</p>

<p>“I will rest here till you return, doctor, then I must
go to him. I tell you no one shall prevent me. I knew
him long ago. My duty is by his side now.”</p>

<p>He saw by her frantic obstinacy that there was more
beneath the surface than her words revealed. To oppose
her would be quite useless.</p>

<p>So he said, assentingly:</p>

<p>“It shall be as you wish, and perhaps his sister will be
glad of your help. She is a feeble old woman, sadly
shaken by the shock. But at least lie quiet till my return,
perfectly quiet, please.”</p>

<p>“I will,” she replied, reluctantly enough; and when he
was gone, she turned toward Janetta, saying:</p>

<p>“This wounded man, Mr. Dawn, was a dear friend of
my youth, and for the sake of past days, we must help
his sister to nurse him till his daughter comes—or till
he dies,” shudderingly again.</p>

<p>Janetta replied with secret amazement:</p>

<p>“I will do my best, madame, and I have been counted
a skillful nurse, but I think you are quite too ill to leave
your room—at least till to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I am stronger than you think. My will-power will
help me through,” replied the obstinate lady; and then she
asked Janetta to dim the light and throw a gauze handkerchief
over her face.</p>

<p>Janetta obeyed, then lay down on a sofa to watch and<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
wait for the doctor’s return. She pretended to be asleep,
thinking that this would suit her mistress best.</p>

<p>Soon she heard low, stifled sobs from beneath the tiny
handkerchief, and guessed that an hysterical mood had
followed on Mrs. Varian’s startling illness and agitation.</p>

<p>It was remarkable for Mrs. Varian—the proud, the
cold, the imperious woman—but Janetta knew it was best
to take no notice and attempt no soothing. The icy crust
of years was broken up at last, and tears must have their
way. They were the greatest panacea for hidden grief.
But the alert maid said to herself:</p>

<p>“Such grief is not for an old friend simply. Doubtless
he was once her lover. Then estrangement followed
and broke their vows. I remember now that she became
ill on the train at the sight of him, and abruptly changed
her mind, getting off here to spend the night. Well, the
Lord’s hand was in it, for we might have been killed
had we stayed on the train,” she concluded, without stopping
to ask herself why she and Mrs. Varian should have
been of so much more value to the world than others that
He should have taken special care to save their lives.</p>

<p>It touched her deeply to hear that stifled sobbing, and
she longed to speak some comforting words; but she knew
it was not best, but lay still till the passion exhausted
itself and Mrs. Varian was passive once more awaiting
the doctor’s return.</p>

<p>It was an hour before he returned, and said:</p>

<p>“I have succeeded in sending off the telegram, and
I find Mr. Dawn in a comatose state from which nothing
perhaps can rouse him till to-morrow. It would be quite
useless your going to him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[207]</span></p>

<p>“Yet, doctor, I must look upon his face to-night!”
And she raised herself in bed, throwing out beseeching
hands.</p>

<p>“I will wait then in the corridor for you and your
maid,” he replied, withdrawing.</p>

<p>Janetta quickly attired her mistress in a comfortable
robe, and gathered her dark, streaming tresses into a
loose knot. Giving her the support of her arm, she led
her out to the old doctor, who quickly came forward to
meet them.</p>

<p>“I have just sent the sister—old Mrs. Flint—to bed,
as she will not be needed now,” he said, leading Mrs.
Varian into his patient’s room.</p>

<p>She needed his arm, for she trembled like a leaf in a
gale. All her pride was trampled in the dust by the love
of old days that rushed over her like a storm, laying
waste all the barriers that anger and scorn had raised
between her heart and the man lying there so deathly
white and still, as if hovering Death had already claimed
him for his victim.</p>

<p>Doctor Deane drew forward a large arm-chair to the
side of the bed, placed Mrs. Varian in it, and abruptly
withdrew, beckoning Janetta to follow.</p>

<p>“You may wait outside the door while I go in to see
another patient. I think the lady would prefer to be alone
for a time,” he said; for he also had his suspicions of
something uncommon in the past of his two strange
patients.</p>

<p>He was right. Mrs. Varian was glad at last to be
alone with Everard Dawn.</p>

<p>She gazed with despairing eyes at his bandaged head,
silent, pallid lips and closed blue eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[208]</span></p>

<p>She bent her haughty head and pressed her fevered
lips on the cold white hand that lay outside the cover,
murmuring passionate words:</p>

<p>“Oh, Everard, it is Pauline! Do you not know it is
Pauline? Oh, do not die without one word to me, one
word of love and pity—you who used to love me so! Is
all the old love dead? Oh, you wronged me bitterly,
Everard, but I can not hate you any longer. The old love
rises in me like an ice-bound stream released by the sunlight,
and drowns me in its overflow. Oh, Everard, my
loved and lost!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">BEYOND FORGIVENESS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Janetta, close against the door outside, caught low, passionate
murmurs from within in her mistress’s voice, and
guessed that she was pouring out her heart’s wild grief
in the insensate ears of the unconscious man. It was
pitiful, and tears overflowed Janetta’s eyes.</p>

<p>For some time the low murmuring continued, then all
grew still as death.</p>

<p>She waited awhile, then fearful that the lady had
fainted again, opened the door and went softly in.</p>

<p>Everard Dawn lay still and silent, just faintly breathing,
as before, and Mrs. Varian’s dark head was bent
down, resting upon the patient’s hand.</p>

<p>She motioned Janetta to her side, saying, gently:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[209]</span></p>

<p>“You may share my vigil, Janetta, and because I know
this seems strange to you, I will confide in you. We loved
each other very dearly once, this man and I, but a wicked
woman came between us and wrecked my happiness. I
tried to hate him, but now that he is dying, the old love
rises in me again, and my heart is breaking.”</p>

<p>That was all; but she knew she was sure of the other
woman’s sympathy.</p>

<p>Janetta might marvel at the utter breaking down of the
proudest woman she had ever known, but she would love
her better for her constancy and her womanly tenderness.</p>

<p>So they kept their lonely vigils by the sufferer, who for
twenty-four hours gave no sign of knowing aught, until
they began to fear that he would pass into the other world
without a sign or token to those left on earth.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flint had been told that an old friend of her
brother would help to nurse him; but when she saw that
it was Mrs. Varian, she was filled with secret wonder
that found expression in the words:</p>

<p>“He never told me that he knew you, madame; but
I do not see how he could have forgotten one like you.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Varian smiled with transient bitterness, but made
no reply to the frank compliment, only showing her appreciation
of it by simple, unaffected kindness to the
grieving sister.</p>

<p>The night and the day wore away, and in the early dusk
of the December eve Everard Dawn suddenly opened his
eyes with full consciousness in them, and met the eager
glance of large, dark, sorrowful orbs.</p>

<p>“Oh, Everard, it is I—<em>Paulina</em>! Do you know me?”
she murmured, prayerfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[210]</span></p>

<p>In a broken whisper, he answered:</p>

<p>“I know you.”</p>

<p>Then his eyes closed again, and with a stifled sob, Mrs.
Varian sent Janetta to tell the doctor.</p>

<p>He hastened to his side, delighted to find that his
patient had rallied; but he whispered to the anxious
watcher:</p>

<p>“I do not dare bid you hope anything from this. The
case is most uncertain.”</p>

<p>She bowed her head in silence; but from that moment
not a movement of the invalid passed unwatched.</p>

<p>He had recovered his consciousness, but the doctor saw
in him as yet no certain chance of recovery. He was
very still and quiet, speaking only when addressed, and
lying always with half-closed eyes that seemed to notice
nothing. At times they opened wider and followed Mrs.
Varian’s movements about the room, but he did not permit
her to surprise that scrutiny.</p>

<p>She was tender, but very timid, scarcely daring to offer
the least attention, lest it be repulsed. There rang in her
memory always some words he had uttered long ago:</p>

<p>“Paulina, you have put upon me an unmerited disgrace
and a cruel wrong. I will never forgive you as long as
I live!”</p>

<p>Again, in the garden at Idlewild, three years ago, he
had said to her most bitterly:</p>

<p>“Do not think I have come to forgive you!”</p>

<p>She had never forgotten the bitterness of those words.
They dazed her, too, for in her own opinion she had been
the only wronged one, he the transgressor.</p>

<p>He was going out of life now, and she read in his
silence that he would keep his word, that for the grievance
he cherished he would not grant forgiveness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[211]</span></p>

<p>Neither would he plead with her for pardon for the
wrong that he had done.</p>

<p>It was a cruel position for both, and she felt that he
only endured her presence for cold pity’s sake, while
secretly wishing her away.</p>

<p>“God help me. I can not bear to leave him!” she
thought, despairingly.</p>

<p>The next morning the travelers from Florida arrived.</p>

<p>Cinthia and her aunt had a most affecting meeting,
though it was the elder woman who broke down and
forced the other to tears.</p>

<p>“Oh, Cinthy, you never loved him as I did! You never
knew him at his best—before sorrow came to him and
spoiled his nature,” she sobbed.</p>

<p>Cinthia could only weep.</p>

<p>“It is not my fault that I was lacking in sympathy.
I was never told of his troubles.”</p>

<p>“He did not wish for you to know, dear, lest your
young life should be saddened more than it was already.”</p>

<p>“Dear aunt, I am very sorry for him, and grieved to
see you looking so pale and thin. Tell me how all this
came about,” pleaded Cinthia. And while they are exchanging
confidences, we will return to Arthur and his
mother.</p>

<p>She had gone to her room to receive him alone, and he
clasped her tenderly in his arms.</p>

<p>“Poor mother!” he sighed, with deep compassion, and
then they sat down and talked awhile together.</p>

<p>“I have one pleasant piece of news for you. Cinthia
and Fred are engaged,” he said.</p>

<p>“I am glad of it—under the circumstances,” she replied,<span class="pagenum">[212]</span>
exactly as he had replied to Frederick’s announcement
of the betrothal.</p>

<p>She mused silently a moment, then added:</p>

<p>“It will be good news for her father. He can die
easier.”</p>

<p>“You are sure that he must die, dear mother?”</p>

<p>“You will not doubt it when you see him, Arthur; and
the physician does not hold out any hope, though he
thinks that the end may be lingering.”</p>

<p>She spoke with the steady calmness of despair, and
her son looked at her with uneasy eyes, wondering how
she felt, how she was bearing it.</p>

<p>Perhaps she read his thoughts, for she said quickly:</p>

<p>“Go to him as soon as you can, dear. Perhaps it may
give him some pleasure to see you by him now. Be kind
and tender—for the sake of old days.”</p>

<p>“And you, mother?”</p>

<p>“I have done what I could—for duty’s sake.”</p>

<p>“Only for that?” he wondered, but dared not ask, and
soon left her to seek Mr. Dawn.</p>

<p>Between the two there was a touching greeting—a
strange one for two men who could only be supposed to
harbor resentment against each other.</p>

<p>Arthur was not ashamed to shed tears when he saw
that helpless form and pallid face with the bandaged head.
His voice trembled while he talked, and Mr. Dawn’s replies
were low and gentle.</p>

<p>“I have kept very quiet. I have saved my strength
till you and Cinthia came. I felt I would have much to
bear then,” he said feebly.</p>

<p>Arthur answered, hopefully:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[213]</span></p>

<p>“I have good news for you. Cinthia has promised to
marry my cousin Frederick Foster. Perhaps she might
bear to know our secret now.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so,” he replied, with a heavy sigh; and just
then the door opened softly again, admitting Mrs. Flint
with his daughter and Madame Ray.</p>

<p>Arthur drew aside and returned to his mother, who
was still alone, having sent Janetta to help with the
wounded woman just across the hall—Rachel Dane.</p>

<p>Mrs. Varian clung to her son, whispering wildly:</p>

<p>“Tell me what brought her here, that beautiful Madame
Ray? Is she aught to him?”</p>

<p>“His daughter’s friend—nothing more, dear mother.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure—quite sure? For Frederick hinted
once that Cinthia wished them to marry. And she is so
charming—perhaps he loves her, Arthur?” jealously.</p>

<p>“No, mother, they are nothing but friends. Her heart
is in the grave. Come, let me tell you her sad, touching
story.”</p>

<p>He drew her to a seat, and went over the sad details
Madame Ray had given him in Florida, drawing bright
tears from his mother’s eyes.</p>

<p>Then some one knocked on the door. It was Doctor
Deane.</p>

<p>“I have been with my patient, Mr. Dawn,” he said,
“and the coming of his daughter has greatly excited
him, causing an improvement for the time, though how
long it may last I can not say. It seems as if there is
something on his mind that he wishes to communicate before
he dies, and he begs you and your son to join him
at once with the others.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">HER SIDE OF THE STORY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Everard Dawn’s haggard eyes marked the entrance of
the doctor and the Varians, and he said feebly:</p>

<p>“Are you all here, Cinthia, Arthur, his mother, my
sister, and my kind friend, Madame Ray?”</p>

<p>“They are all here,” Doctor Deane replied; and Everard
Dawn continued:</p>

<p>“I should like Mr. Foster to be present, too—and Mrs.
Varian’s maid. She may need her ministrations in a
trying scene. You, too, doctor, I would like to have stay
if you can bear the disclosure of family secrets.”</p>

<p>The old doctor answered, genially:</p>

<p>“I have no wish to pry into family secrets, but it is
best that I should stay, that I may render assistance
should you overtax your feeble powers.”</p>

<p>They brought Frederick Foster and Janetta, and there
were eight of them forming a curious, anxious group
about the bed.</p>

<p>Across the hall, gasping for breath, and tossing restlessly
from side to side in the pain of internal injuries,
was a woman who would have taken as great an interest
as any in the novel scene transpiring so close to her; but
no one gave her a single thought, no one supposed that
the humble servant, Rachel Dane, could have taken any
interest in the event, much less have thrown a light on<span class="pagenum">[215]</span>
the dark mystery that had saddened several hopeful lives.
Everything had been so closely guarded that little of it
had come to her knowledge. Janetta had told her that
Mr. Dawn’s daughter and her friends had come, that was
all.</p>

<p>The suffering woman had a lively interest to see Cinthia,
whom she had nursed as a little child, and of whom
her aunt had talked so much, but she knew that her
curiosity must bide the proper time.</p>

<p>A house-maid had come in just now, and said:</p>

<p>“Janetta, you are wanted in Mr. Dawn’s room. I will
stay here until you come back.”</p>

<p>Janetta went as bidden, and stationed herself at the
back of the arm-chair where her mistress was sitting,
close to the bed.</p>

<p>Then Everard Dawn exclaimed, clearly:</p>

<p>“Paulina!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Varian gave a convulsive start and looked fearfully
at the speaker.</p>

<p>His blue eyes met hers full with a commanding expression,
as he continued:</p>

<p>“Paulina, in meeting my daughter here on my dying
bed she has demanded to know the details of the feud
as she believes it, that shadowed so darkly the last three
years of her young life. Once I would have died to shield
her from such sorrow, but now she declares that certainty
of sorrow is better than the pangs of suspense. She demands<span class="pagenum">[216]</span>
the truth. It is our bitter duty to yield to her
desires.”</p>

<p>A hushed murmur of surprise went around the group,
and Cinthia buried her face on Madame Ray’s bosom.</p>

<p>She had indeed pleaded with her father for the truth,
and he had promised to gratify her wish, though she
wondered why he added:</p>

<p>“There was indeed a terrible reason why you could
not marry Arthur, my dear child, and it would have
killed you at first to know it, but now that you love another
man, and are engaged to marry him, you will not
mind so much.”</p>

<p>They had startled her strangely, those words, and she
hung tremblingly on every sentence that fell now from her
father’s lips, and before she hid her pallid face she had
seen Arthur draw his chair close to his mother’s side—the
mother he loved so dearly still, though she had parted
him so cruelly from his beautiful betrothed.</p>

<p>Again Everard Dawn breathed through pallid, pain-drawn
lips:</p>

<p>“All I ask of you, Paulina, is that you shall tell your
side of our marriage and divorce. I will follow with my
version of the story.”</p>

<p>The listeners could scarcely express outcries of surprise.</p>

<p>Everard Dawn had revealed to them all in one brief
sentence a totally unsuspected fact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[217]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Varian, the wealthy, beautiful, haughty woman,
was his divorced wife.</p>

<p>Cinthia trembled with surprise, and clung closer to
her loving friend, who thought quickly.</p>

<p>“My suspicions and forebodings are about to be verified.
Alas, poor Cinthia!”</p>

<p>Arthur Varian drew his arm about his mother, whispering
to her of courage in this trying hour, begging her
to gratify the sick man’s request.</p>

<p>Everard Dawn waited a moment, then added:</p>

<p>“You may make the story as short as you please, only
let it come from your own lips.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Varian lifted her head with something of her old
haughty pride, and looked at Cinthia where she drooped
against her friend’s breast, but her voice was slightly
tremulous as she began:</p>

<p>“When I first met your father, Cinthia, he was a rising
young lawyer employed by my father to attend to some
complicated business matters. Our acquaintance ripened
into love, and he became a suitor for my hand against my
father’s wishes. But as my lover’s only fault was poverty
and we were rich, I soon persuaded papa to withdraw
his objections. So we were married.”</p>

<p>She paused and sighed, and every one heard Everard
Dawn re-echo that sigh heavily.</p>

<p>“Go on, dear,” whispered Arthur, encouragingly, with
an anxious look at Cinthia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[218]</span></p>

<p>“We were very happy, for my husband seemed a model of
manly perfection,” continued Mrs. Varian. “We lived
in Florida with my dear father, who made Everard the
manager of all his investments, thus insuring him independence
of my fortune, for he was very proud and impatient
of being thought a fortune-hunter. Arthur was
born when I had been married one year, and until he was
four years old I was the happiest woman on earth.”</p>

<p>Everard Dawn gave her a sudden bright look that she
did not perceive, as if grateful for those words.</p>

<p>Again sighing, she continued:</p>

<p>“Then a dark shadow fell over Love’s Retreat—the
shadow of a beautiful young girl, the daughter of a
former client of my husband. She arrived suddenly at
our home one day, bearing a letter from her father who
had recently died. In it he commended the girl—Gladys
Lowe—to the guardianship of my husband, begging that
he would keep her at his home till she married. To be
brief, her father’s property dwindled to nothing when it
came to be settled up, leaving her penniless on our hands—a
charge I would most generously have undertaken
but for the predilection Miss Lowe immediately manifested
for my husband, driving me wild with her kittenish
coquetries, for she was very charming, with abundant
tawny locks and effective hazel eyes, that were always
fixed on Everard with a passion she could not disguise.
The Varians are charged with being jealous people, and I
do not deny it; I feared she would win my husband with<span class="pagenum">[219]</span>
her blandishments, and I imperiously demanded of him
that he send Miss Lowe away.”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A MORTAL WOUND.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Every one in the room was listening with suppressed
excitement to Mrs. Varian’s story, every eye was fixed
on her mortally pale face, so deathlike in its pallor save
for the great Oriental dark eyes burning like coals of fire.</p>

<p>Cinthia had grown ghastly, too, as she rested in the
clasp of Madame Ray’s arm, taking no heed of her handsome
betrothed on the other side, hovering near to console
her in the terrible revelation soon coming.</p>

<p>The lady paused, drew her breath in sharply, like one
in pain, and resumed:</p>

<p>“I could not bring my husband to believe in the sincerity
of my objections to his ward. He first laughed at
my jealousy, then upbraided me with my injustice to a
homeless orphan girl. He could not send her away penniless
into the world, for he had been under obligations to
her father, in whose office he had gained his first law
practice. He begged me to have patience and charity
toward Miss Lowe until her superior attractions should
win her a husband. Heaven knows I was never lacking
in Christian charity toward any unfortunate person, but<span class="pagenum">[220]</span>
Gladys Lowe was not a good girl. A flirt to her fingertips,
and totally without principle or conscience, she discovered
my jealousy and played on it cleverly, augmenting
it by cunning schemes that my husband never suspected,
and that I, in my bitter pride and jealousy, never betrayed
to him. So matters went on for a year, and in
that interval of time I several times surprised my husband
in compromising situations with his ward. By my
father’s advice, I ordered her to leave my house, and
there was a stormy scene.</p>

<p>“Miss Lowe threw shame to the winds. She refused
to go, and taunted me with having won my husband from
me. I threatened to sue him for divorce, naming her as
co-respondent. She retorted that it was what they both
wished, in order that he might obtain his freedom to
marry her. Without a word to my husband—for we
had long been estranged through our differences over
her—I left my home, taking my little son, and accompanied
by my father, who fully sympathized with my
grievances and despised the authors of my unhappiness.
I then carried out my threat of suing my husband for
divorce, implicating Miss Lowe. To cut the story short,
my husband fought against the divorce; but his shameless
ward helped it on by every art in her power, never
denying the charges against her; and it was soon granted,
giving me the custody of our son and the liberty to resume
my maiden name. Mr. Dawn removed from Florida
to Georgia, where Miss Lowe followed him, and<span class="pagenum">[221]</span>
within a few months he married her, thus proving his
falsity to me.”</p>

<p>Her story was ended, and she leaned her head back
against Arthur’s shoulder, closing her eyes to shut out
the sight of the surprised and pitying faces to whom
she had just confessed the story of her life’s humiliation.</p>

<p>“Bravely done, dear mother!” whispered Arthur, with
a gentle kiss on her cold cheek.</p>

<p>“It is my turn now,” said Everard Dawn, with a
heavy sigh, and Doctor Deane rejoined:</p>

<p>“I can not permit you to talk very long, my dear
patient.”</p>

<p>“It will not be necessary, sir, for Mrs. Varian has
saved me the trouble of a long explanation. What she
has related is perfectly true on the face of it, but behind
the tragedy of our divorce lie the actual facts of the
terrible mistakes of a jealous woman and a heedless man
too secure of his great happiness to guard it close
enough.”</p>

<p>A great thrill ran through the listeners, as he continued:</p>

<p>“I hold myself to blame that I was impatient of my
wife’s jealousy, and laughed at her fears that Miss Lowe
was trying to win my heart. I pitied my ward for her
orphanage and poverty, and I was too generous to believe
that she was aught but a joyous-hearted girl whose
little kittenish coquetries amounted to nothing. I was
simply blind, besides being inordinately proud and passionately
resentful of my wife’s unjust suspicions. I loved<span class="pagenum">[222]</span>
her to idolatry, and her lack of faith angered me. I carried
everything with too high a hand, perhaps, but I did
not dream to what lengths the affair was going.”</p>

<p>Doctor Deane interposed gently:</p>

<p>“You are exhausting your strength by too long a discourse.”</p>

<p>“Doctor, what difference can it make to a dying man
whether his little stock of strength is exhausted sooner
or later?” wearily.</p>

<p>“Go on then; but be brief.”</p>

<p>“I found out too late,” continued Everard Dawn, “that
Miss Lowe was different from what I thought. She had
indeed conceived a mad love for me that had driven her
to desperate lengths to win me. It is true that she followed
me to Georgia, true that I married her, but only
because of her passionate pleadings and assertions that
through my wife’s jealousy her character had been ruined.
I gave her the shelter of my name, but, God forgive me,
I hated her as long as she lived, and could not help rejoicing
when she was dead. I obtained a position as a
commercial traveler, so that I could spend most of my
time away from her side, so her victory was a poor one
after all, for she had wrecked two lives without gaining
any happiness for herself. As for the rest, I affirm now
on my death-bed and on my hopes of heaven, that Gladys
Lowe and I were as innocent of wrong-doing before my
divorce as the purest angel. She was wicked enough to<span class="pagenum">[223]</span>
make my wife believe it, through her jealousy so easily
imposed on, but she was not guilty, so help me Heaven!”</p>

<p>He paused, and there rose a stifled cry of bitter anguish.
It came from Cinthia’s ghastly lips as the cruel
truth began to dawn on her bewildered brain.</p>

<p>Everard Dawn looked at her pityingly, and said:</p>

<p>“Ah, Cinthia, you understand it all now. She was
your mother. Perhaps you will not blame me now that
I failed in love to you, that I forgot my duty to you in
resentment at what you represented—the wicked love of
a woman who wrecked my life in parting me from all
that made it dear.”</p>

<p>A low moan came from her blanched lips and Arthur
Varian left his mother’s side and approached her with
leaden-weighted feet and a look as of death’s agony in
his fixed blue eyes. He took her hand, and said, hollowly:</p>

<p>“Cinthia, you understand it all now, but you will not
mind it, I know, because Fred is going to make you very
happy, my dear little <em>sister</em>.”</p>

<p>No one in that room ever forgot the white agony of
Cinthia Dawn’s face as she sprung to her feet, with outstretched
arms, quivering all over as if a bullet had pierced
her heart, pushing Arthur away as if his hand had given
the mortal wound.</p>

<p>“Oh, God, let me die!” she shrieked, in her despair,
and sunk senseless in Madame Ray’s arms.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XL">CHAPTER XL.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A LATE REPENTANCE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Doctor Deane feared that all that excitement must hurt
his patient very much, so he cleared the room as soon
as possible, letting no one stay but Mrs. Flint and himself.</p>

<p>She, poor old lady, was terribly shocked at hearing the
full story of her brother’s life, having only known a few
hazy details before.</p>

<p>But she pulled herself together the best she could, and
hung tenderly over the bedside, chafing her brother’s cold
hands, and murmuring:</p>

<p>“Poor Everard! how cruelly you have been wronged,
and how sad your life has been! If I had known all the
truth, I could never have blamed you for neglecting
Cinthy, though it is a pity, for a sweeter girl never lived,
I am sure. She can not have inherited her disposition
from her wicked mother.”</p>

<p>He looked at her kindly, but he was too exhausted by
all he had endured to answer, but lay, pale and gasping,
among the pillows, while the doctor busied himself with
restoratives.</p>

<p>“All this excitement has been very bad for him, and
he must have quiet and sleep the rest of the day,” he said
uneasily, before he went out to see after his other patients.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[225]</span></p>

<p>They had carried Cinthia to her own room, where
Madame Ray hung over her with tearful devotion excluding
every one else, even her anxious betrothed, who
hung about in most disconsolate fashion.</p>

<p>Janetta returned to her watch by Rachel Dane, and
Arthur accompanied his mother to her own apartments,
mastering his own agitation in his tenderness for her
trouble.</p>

<p>“You will lie down and rest, dear mother, or you will
be ill after this fatiguing ordeal,” he pleaded.</p>

<p>She was pacing restlessly up and down the floor, a
picture of nervous suffering painful to gaze upon. Pausing
in the center of the room, her white, jeweled fingers
locked together as if in pain, she looked at him with
burning eyes, crying wildly:</p>

<p>“Oh, Arthur, how can I rest, how can I sleep? <em>He</em> is
dying, and I—I am full of doubt and terror! Awakened
conscience daunts me. Have I wronged him or not? Is
he innocent, or is he guilty?”</p>

<p>“Mother you heard him swear to his innocence by all
his hopes of heaven!”</p>

<p>“He swore to it before, Arthur, on the day when I
sued him for divorce. He came to me swearing his innocence,
pleading for mercy. I turned from him in anger,
refusing to believe him, scorning all his prayers.”</p>

<p>“How could you be so hard, mother?”</p>

<p>“I was mad with wounded love and jealousy. I had
let that fiendish girl destroy, with cunning arts, all my<span class="pagenum">[226]</span>
faith in him. Besides, my father was against him. He
feared he had married me for my wealth alone.”</p>

<p>“Poor mother, how you were tortured! No wonder
you made such a fatal mistake.”</p>

<p>“Arthur, Arthur,” her voice rang out wildly, “you
believe that it was a mistake?”</p>

<p>He came up to her, put his hands on her shoulders,
and looked at her earnestly, tenderly.</p>

<p>“Mother, must I tell you frankly what I believe, what
I have believed in my soul ever since my first interview
with my father, that day in Washington?”</p>

<p>“Yes; speak the whole truth, though it crushes me!”
sighed the unhappy woman; and he answered:</p>

<p>“I do not mean to be cruel to you, dear mother, I pity
you, and I understand your terrible provocation for all
you did, but I believe in my father’s innocence and his
perfect nobility. He told me his full story in Washington,
and I have believed in him, loved him, revered him ever
since, and his death will be a blow to me only second to
your own.”</p>

<p>“Then, Arthur, I am a miserable sinner. I have
wrecked his life!” contritely.</p>

<p>“Then you must acknowledge your fault, and beg
his forgiveness.”</p>

<p>“He has sworn that he will never forgive me as long
as I live. Oh, my heart, what a cruel wretch I have
been to him! And I loved him so! I do not merit his
forgiveness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[227]</span></p>

<p>“But he shall grant it, mother. I will add my prayers
to yours.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Arthur, shall we go to him now, my poor,
wronged love?” weeping.</p>

<p>“Not now, dear mother, because he is exhausted, and
needs rest. We must wait.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if he could know my shame and repentance!
And how I have loved him always in spite of myself!
Might it not comfort him, Arthur?”</p>

<p>“I will find out when he can see you, and tell you
himself, mother, if you will be very patient, and let him
rest awhile first, mother.”</p>

<p>“I will wait as long as you wish me, Arthur, my poor
boy, for I need your forgiveness, too. I have wronged
you also, depriving you these long and weary years of a
father’s love. Besides, there was all your bitter trouble
over Cinthia. But thank Heaven, it is all over now, that
sorrow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is all over now,” he said, calmly, but with
white lips.</p>

<p>And then he went away to his father’s room, where
Mrs. Flint was sitting alone, wishing he were not so
restless, fearing it was a bad sign.</p>

<p>Arthur bent over him caressingly, and whispered:</p>

<p>“My poor mother, after years of sorrow, divided between
doubt and anger, is at last convinced of your innocence,
and her poor heart is breaking with remorse for
her sin and love that she could never conquer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[228]</span></p>

<p>He saw a strange gleam in the deep blue eyes, and
the pale lips twitched with emotion.</p>

<p>He continued, almost pleadingly:</p>

<p>“Her pride is humbled in the dust, and her dearest
wish is to express her penitence and pray for forgiveness.
Her sin was great, but, dear father, you have a noble
heart. Is it shut against her forever?”</p>

<p>What a light came over the pallid face, what strange
new fire to the dim eyes, what deep emotion quivered in
the voice that answered:</p>

<p>“When your mother first entered into my heart Arthur,
she locked the door and threw away the key forever.
How could I bar her out after lifelong possession?”</p>

<p>“Oh, father, what a constant heart! Yet she fears
that you can never forgive her.”</p>

<p>“In the passion of wounded love and anger, I swore
that I would not, Arthur; but that was long ago, and in
the face of death, how puerile these worldy resentments
seem! Then, too, I believed she had wearied of me, believed
me a fortune-hunter. Her wealth and her pride
raised a wall between us. I could not dream that lips
like hers could ever stoop to that word ‘forgive.’”</p>

<p>“Would you like to hear her say it now, my father?”</p>

<p>“No, Arthur, for it is needless. If she could come
to me with another word—the dear word love—it would
pay for all. How sweet to die with her hand in mine, her
lips on my brow!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[229]</span></p>

<p>Ah, what a love was here!—so patient under cruel
wrong, so faithful, so forgiving! Arthur’s nature bowed
in reverence to its holiness.</p>

<p>“She will come when you wish,” he said gently.</p>

<p>“Let it be now, Arthur.”</p>

<p>“But Doctor Deane said——” began his sister, uneasily.</p>

<p>“I can not permit any one to dictate in this. Every
moment of suspense counts against my life,” the patient
answered, firmly, and Arthur went.</p>

<p>It was but a little while before he returned with a
drooping figure on his arm.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flint safely withdrew to a window, with her
back to the bed.</p>

<p>Arthur led his mother to the bedside, and placed her
in a chair. Then he took her cold and trembling hand,
and placed it in that of his father.</p>

<p>She thrilled with a passion of joy at the feeble pressure,
and bent forward, pressing her quivering lips to his pale
brow, whispering in a tempest of restrained emotion:</p>

<p>“Oh, Everard, I wronged you—but I never ceased to
love you!”</p>

<p>And there was deep silence and rare happiness—even
though the shadow of death hovered over the room. And
presently she whispered, entreatingly:</p>

<p>“Oh, Everard, do not die and leave me now! I can
not let you go again! I will nurse you and tend you so
faithfully that surely Heaven will give you back to me!
And some day, when I have somewhat atoned by penitence<span class="pagenum">[230]</span>
and devotion, perhaps you will let me be your wife
again.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Paulina, if it might be <em>now</em>, for the doctor does
not hold out any hope of life. But at least I should die
happy, knowing you were mine again.”</p>

<p>“You shall have your wish!” cried Arthur, hastening
from the room.</p>

<p>Then Everard Dawn called his sister to make friends
with Paulina.</p>

<p>“I should like for you to love each other when I am
gone,” he said gently.</p>

<p>“Oh, brother, we can not let you go now, when happiness
has come to you again! I am praying for you every
moment!” cried the kind old lady, clasping hands with
the beautiful woman whom she would be proud to call
sister.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“THE GREED OF GOLD.”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Meanwhile, Janetta, watching by the bedside of Rachel
Dane, did not like the looks of her patient.</p>

<p>The woman had been very bad from the first, her body
covered with bruises, and complaining of severe inward
pains that indicated internal injuries.</p>

<p>All that medical skill could do, combined with careful<span class="pagenum">[231]</span>
nursing, had been lavished on the sufferer; but it was
quite evident that her days were numbered.</p>

<p>To-day she was restless and querulous, sliding down
in bed, and picking at the covers in an ominous way.</p>

<p>“Where is my mistress?” she inquired, presently:
adding in a fretful tone; “she has entirely neglected me
to-day.”</p>

<p>Janetta soothingly made excuses for Mrs. Flint, saying
that her niece had arrived that morning, and they had
been together in the room of Mr. Dawn, who was not
expected to live long.</p>

<p>“I should like to see Miss Dawn,” Rachel Dane muttered,
curiously.</p>

<p>“That would be impossible, for the young lady was
quite prostrated by the excitement in her father’s room,
and was carried to bed just now, with the doctor in attendance,”
replied Janetta.</p>

<p>Rachel Dane kept silence quite a little while, then she
sharply ordered Janetta to go away and send Mrs. Flint.</p>

<p>The maid obeyed, only too glad to get away from the
grewsome company of the dying woman.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flint came at once, wan and weary from excitement,
but full of kindly sympathy.</p>

<p>“Rachel, I am sorry to see that you are not so well
to-day,” she said.</p>

<p>“So you can see it? Well, I felt it myself; that’s why
I wanted you. I knew you would tell me the truth. Am
I going to die?” querulously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[232]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Flint had been by many a death-bed, and she saw
the signs here, so she answered, frankly:</p>

<p>“Rachel, I don’t want to frighten you, but it’s time you
should make your peace with God.”</p>

<p>The poor wretch shuddered and moaned:</p>

<p>“Are you sure? Did the doctor say so, ma’am?”</p>

<p>“He has never had any hope of your recovery, Rachel,
and you are failing fast to-day. You will soon be done
with this world; but, alas! you are not ready for the next
one.”</p>

<p>She did not want to frighten the parting soul but she
was sorrowful over the life going out into eternal darkness.</p>

<p>Rachel Dane shuddered, and cried:</p>

<p>“I always meant to get ready when the time came
but it caught me unprepared. I’m only fifty odd years
old, and I hoped to live to ninety. Oh, tell me what to do!
help me, pray for me!”</p>

<p>“I’ve prayed for you, Rachel Dane, ever since you
made your home under my roof, and I’m glad your heart
is softened at last. Try to love God and believe in His
goodness. Say after me: ‘Lord, forgive a dying sinner,
and save me, for Christ’s sake! Amen.’”</p>

<p>The dying creature clutched at the bed-clothes, and
mumbled the words in pitiful earnest, after which Mrs.
Flint knelt by the bed, and herself offered up a fervent
prayer.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve been bad and wicked all my life, hating God<span class="pagenum">[233]</span>
because I was poor! I don’t know how to get His favor
now,” sighed the dying sinner; and Mrs. Flint answered,
soothingly:</p>

<p>“If you have done anything wicked that you can undo,
now is the time to repent and get God’s forgiveness.”</p>

<p>She saw a look of alarm come into the fading eyes, and
Rachel plucked wildly at the counterpane, muttering:</p>

<p>“I did a cruel wrong twenty years ago. I stole the baby
daughter of a heart-broken young widow.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens! how dreadful! Tell me all about it
quickly, and perhaps something may yet be done to right
the wrong,” cried Mrs. Flint, in dismay.</p>

<p>But at that moment they were interrupted by the opening
of the door, and Madame Ray glided in, murmuring
in her sweet, soft voice:</p>

<p>“They told me you were watching by a very sick
woman, and as Cinthia is asleep, I thought I might be of
some assistance to you.”</p>

<p>She had never heard the name of Rachel Dane, and
she came and stood by the bed, looking down, with pity
and sympathy, at the poor soul.</p>

<p>Rachel Dane turned her heavy eyes upward to the
lovely face, and then uttered a cry of deadly fear:</p>

<p>“My God! it is Mrs. Ray, come to haunt me in my
dying hour!”</p>

<p>“Rachel Dane, where is my child, my baby daughter?”
cried the other, wildly; and, shaking with excitement, she<span class="pagenum">[234]</span>
added: “Do not die, miserable wretch, till you reveal
the truth.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Flint stared in wonder, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“The poor woman was just confessing to me that
she had stolen a young widow’s child twenty years ago.
Go on with your story, Rachel.”</p>

<p>She pushed the agitated lady into a chair as she spoke,
and waited with eager curiosity and sympathy for the
next words.</p>

<p>Rachel looked fearfully at the woman she had wronged,
and muttered:</p>

<p>“Do not look so wretched, lady, for all is well with
your daughter, and she shall be restored to your arms.”</p>

<p>“Thank God—thank God!” cried the mother, with a
rush of glad tears.</p>

<p>“So it was Madame Ray’s child that you stole, Rachel?
But why did you do such a wicked thing?” cried her
mistress.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Flint, it was for the greed of gold, that has
always cursed my life—the longing for gold and pleasure!
A beautiful woman came to me, and said: ‘I have been
married two years, and I have no child. My husband will
never love me till I give him an heir. I would like a little
girl because his first wife had a boy, and I hate it. Find
me a pretty baby, and help me to impose it on him as my
own when he returns from his long journey, and you shall
live with me, and I will make you rich.’ Wretch that I
was, I stole Mrs. Ray’s sweet baby, and helped the other<span class="pagenum">[235]</span>
woman to fool her husband. She paid me well; but growing
weary of my extortions after two years, she and her
husband stole away North, where I could never trace
them, till one night I saw him on the train and followed
him, only to find that his wife had died years before.”</p>

<p>“But my child, my darling, where is she?” sobbed the
eager mother.</p>

<p>“Where is the child?” echoed Mrs. Flint, suspiciously,
and Rachel Dane answered, gladly:</p>

<p>“Oh, how glad I am to restore her safe to her mother’s
arms! She is here with you, Mrs. Flint—the girl called
Cinthia Dawn, but no kin of yours, for she is the baby I
stole for Mrs. Dawn, the unloved wife—the child of Mrs.
Richard Ray, and may Heaven forgive my sin!”</p>

<p>When Arthur Varian Dawn left his father’s room so
hastily that day, it was with the firm determination to
see his parents married again before the set of sun, if it
could possibly be accomplished without injury to his
father’s poor hold on life.</p>

<p>He had a brief talk with Doctor Deane, who agreed
with him that the consummation of so joyful an event
ought to do good to the patient, giving him new hold on
life, if such a thing were possible in his precarious state.</p>

<p>“I do not wish to deceive you,” he said, with professional
frankness. “The case is serious. I am not frightened
at the scalp-wound, because it is doing nicely, and
the compound fracture of the leg, below the knee, might
get well in six weeks if the patient will lie in bed all that
time; but there are symptoms of internal injuries that
make me uneasy. If I am mistaken about that, he may
pull through.”</p>

<p>“God grant it!” cried Arthur, fervently.</p>

<p>“And as you say,” continued the doctor, “whether he
lives or dies, it will be a comfort to him to marry his
divorced wife over again, so I will go with you to get the
license and the preacher.”</p>

<p>So, together with Frederick Foster, they went to arrange
the necessary details, and in their absence there occurred
that scene by the death-bed of Rachel Dane that
was to make such a change in the destinies of Arthur and
Cinthia, the sorely tried lovers.</p>

<p>When they returned, several hours later, with the minister,<span class="pagenum">[237]</span>
Mrs. Flint was informed of what was about to
occur, and begged her new-found nephew to let her have
the services of the man of God first for a dying sinner.</p>

<p>“Poor Rachel Dane is going fast, and she is afraid
to die, poor soul! We must try to hold a light for her
feet, as she goes groping down into the dark valley,” she
said, pitifully.</p>

<p>“Has her life been so wicked?” he asked, wonderingly;
and the old lady answered:</p>

<p>“She has lived without God, and her sins are many.
She made a most interesting confession awhile ago, and
I would like for you to go and hear it, dear nephew, from
Madame Ray, while the minister is engaged with Rachel.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Flint spoke with such a glad and cheerful smile,
that he was quite puzzled.</p>

<p>He was sorry for the dying woman, but not much interested
in her sins and confessions. His thoughts were
hovering around Cinthia.</p>

<p>She had been carried unconscious from Mr. Dawn’s
room, and only revived to go into such hysterical spasms
that they almost feared for her life. It was thought best
to quiet her by strong opiates, and she had been sleeping
heavily now for hours.</p>

<p>Poor Cinthia! They had thought the truth would not
shock her now, because she was betrothed to another;
but they had been terribly mistaken. The hopeless love
that had tortured her heart with secret pain threatened to<span class="pagenum">[238]</span>
end in death or madness, now that they had told her that
Arthur was her brother.</p>

<p>With an aching heart, the young man turned his steps
to her door to ask Madame Ray how the hapless girl
fared.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the lady had hurried from Rachel’s death-bed
back to Cinthia’s room.</p>

<p>Kneeling down, she pressed joyful kisses on the sleeping
face, so pale and woeful even in slumber, so that it
was easy to guess at last the guarded secret of that young
heart—the love that had never strayed from its object
through long and hopeless years.</p>

<p>Softly, tenderly the happy mother drew aside the soft
folds of lace and lines, and laid bare the beautiful white
bosom of her daughter, searching until she found, just
above the heart a remembered birthmark—a tiny crimson
cross.</p>

<p>“The birthmark of the Rays! Oh, how well I remember
this! Oh, my darling, my own, you are indeed
my lost treasure! No wonder that I have always loved
you so! It was the mother-heart that claimed you!”
she cried, gladly, longing for Cinthia to awake and
learn the happy truth that she was her own daughter, and
not at all related to Arthur, whom she might marry when
she would, only for the rash promise given to Fred Foster
in a moment of reckless pride.</p>

<p>“Poor fellow! This will be sad news for him; but
I believe that he will be generous to dear Cinthia,” she<span class="pagenum">[239]</span>
concluded; and sat down to watch the sleeper with the
glad eyes of love.</p>

<p>It was awhile later that she heard a timid rap at the
door, and found Arthur waiting outside, with a grave, sad
face, though he said cheerfully:</p>

<p>“I have come to invite you and Cinthia to a wedding.”</p>

<p>“A wedding?”</p>

<p>In a few words he told her of the reconciliation between
his father and mother, and the impending marriage.</p>

<p>She congratulated him warmly, and said, meaningly:</p>

<p>“I will be glad to be present at the ceremony, but my
daughter is asleep.”</p>

<p>Arthur started wildly, and echoed:</p>

<p>“Your daughter!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Arthur;” and she drew him gently into the
room. “Come and look at her, how pale and ill she lies,
almost stricken to death by the thought that she was
your sister. Oh, I have such happy news for you both,
Arthur!”</p>

<p>“She is stirring, she is waking!” he exclaimed, eagerly;
and indeed at that moment the girl opened wide her large
dark eyes, with a dazed look.</p>

<p>Madame Ray, all joyful excitement, covered her daughter’s
face with kisses, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Oh, Cinthia, oh, Arthur, such joyful news! I have
found out that you are my lost daughter, my darling! You
know, Arthur, you always declared we resembled each
other. Well, the nurse stole her from me to sell her to<span class="pagenum">[240]</span>
your father’s second wife; for she deceived her husband,
the wicked woman; she never had a child of her own.
That dying woman in yonder, Rachel Dane, has confessed
everything. You and Cinthia are not brother and sister
at all, but lovers as in past days. Kiss her, Arthur, if
you wish, and be happy again.”</p>

<p>He bent down to obey, but drew back again, with a
cry of grief:</p>

<p>“I can not! She is promised to my cousin.”</p>

<p>“He will give her back her freedom when he learns
the truth, for he has a noble nature,” cried Madame Ray;
and the event proved that she was right.</p>

<p>Fred Foster’s heart was very sad already, for Cinthia’s
grief had shown him, but awhile ago, that he could never
hope to win her heart; so, when he heard the wonderful
news, and saw the new joy on Cinthia’s lovely face, he
said, generously:</p>

<p>“Cinthia, I have long known of your past love affair
with Arthur, and since things have fallen out so happily
for you, I will restore you the troth-plight so lately given,
and trust to time to heal my heart-wound. To-morrow is
Christmas you know, and I shall present you as a precious
gift to Arthur.”</p>

<p>Oh, how thankful they were for his generosity, and
how glad that another love cured his heart in a year,
though they were touched when they saw that she resembled
Cinthia in her type—dark eyes and golden hair.
It showed them plainly how deep had been his love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[241]</span></p>

<p>Cinthia was well again almost in a minute, in her new
joy, and anxious to witness the second marriage ceremony
between Arthur’s parents; so presently the same group
of the morning gathered in the room, and the grave minister
who had just closed the eyes of Rachel Dane, after
teaching her soul to find rest in God, joined the hands
of Everard Dawn and his Paulina for the journey of
life, while he solemnly invoked God’s blessing on them
all.</p>

<p>Everard Dawn could not die now. Life had grown too
sweet again. Events proved that the physician’s fear of
internal injuries was unfounded. He began to convalesce
slowly but surely under his wife’s love and care,
looking forward to happy years together in the golden
future.</p>

<p>Rachel Dane was buried at Charlottesville, and as she
had no known relatives anywhere, Mrs. Flint was the
chief mourner at the funeral, and she took care to have
a neat stone raised above the grave.</p>

<p>In a few days the party at the hotel separated, Everard
Dawn’s wife and son remaining with him to aid in
the tedious convalescence, and Madame Ray returning
to Florida with her daughter, taking the ailing Mrs. Flint
as their guest.</p>

<p>“I am real down sorry to lose you as a niece, Cinthy,”
sighed the old lady, who was greatly softened now by the
hurrying events.</p>

<p>“Do not grieve over that, dear aunt, for I will restore<span class="pagenum">[242]</span>
the kinship in the spring, and in the meantime you have
gained me as a nephew!” laughed Arthur, who was
handsome as a picture in his new happiness.</p>

<p>“That is true; and I am real down proud of my new
nephew, and his mother, too!” cried the old lady.</p>

<p>Arthur’s mother had taken the first opportunity to
make her peace with Cinthia.</p>

<p>“Dearest, I was cruel to you once, but I am a changed
woman now, and I love you dearly since I know that you
never belonged to that woman I hated so. Can you forgive
me—if not for my own sake, because you will be
Arthur’s wife!”</p>

<p>Cinthia, understanding everything now, gladly accorded
forgiveness and sympathy that soon ripened into love.</p>

<p>In the spring, when Mr. Dawn was well and strong
again, his son was married to Cinthia at her mother’s
home—Lodge Delight. It was a grand wedding, and
Cinthia the fairest bride ever seen. They remained with
Madame Ray until Love’s Retreat was rebuilt, then made
their home with his parents, while Mrs. Flint remained
ever afterward with Cinthia’s mother, who would not
permit her return to Virginia.</p>

<p>“We are two lonely old widows. Let us be company
for each other,” she said, with pensive cheerfulness.</p>

<p>One thing that transpired touched Cinthia very much,
and showed her the tenderness of Arthur’s love.</p>

<p>Madame Ray said to Mr. Dawn, while he still lay on
his bed of suffering:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[243]</span></p>

<p>“That fortune Cinthia has been enjoying as your
daughter, Mr. Dawn, must be restored to you now, as
she never had any legal right to it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dawn looked embarrassed for a moment, then
frankly explained:</p>

<p>“On the day that Arthur found out that Cinthia was
supposedly his sister, he insisted on making over to her
use enough of his private fortune to insure her the luxuries
of life in lieu of happiness.”</p>

<p>“And it will now form part of her marriage settlement,”
added Arthur.</p>

<p>Tears sprung to Cinthia’s eyes as she murmured:</p>

<p>“Oh, how noble and generous you have been all these
years while I thought you so weak and cowardly, and
tried in vain to hate you! But all the while——”</p>

<p>Arthur drew her to his heart, and finished the sentence
for her, very low and tenderly:</p>

<p>—“All the while—I loved you better than you knew.”</p>

<p>This is the most remarkable book
which has appeared during the present

true history of that arch
criminal, the burglar and murderer,
Charles Peace, who for many years
masqueraded in England under many
different personalities, but always as that of a respectable

and from other points of view when Justice finally caught
and executed him upon the scaffold the world was well rid
of him.</p>

<p>He started his career when he was eleven years old and
during the different periods when he was outside of prison,
masquerading always as a respectable business man, he
changed his personality when the darkness of night fell and
carried out the boldest robberies and the most daring criminal
schemes ever perpetrated by any one man in the history of
the world.</p>

<p>No other criminal who ever lived could compare in cunning
and daring with Charles Peace, the Master Criminal. Read
